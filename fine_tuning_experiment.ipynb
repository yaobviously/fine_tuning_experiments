      " Should People Ever Agree To Disagree?  Some people think it’s a good idea for people to agree on some things, but disagree on others. For example, they agree that democracy is better than monarchy, but disagree on what the best democratic system is. I agree that it is a good idea for people to have some such divisions of opinion, so that they can discuss the issues in depth. But I don’t think people should ever agree to disagree on all issues.I’m not saying that people should all agree on the same things. Different people should probably have different opinions on this subject. But I’m saying that people should all agree on the same thing: namely, that they should never ever agree to disagree. People should always feel free to disagree with anyone. When people disagree, they should feel free to fight and even kill each other. That is the only way to make sure that no one ever gets too convinced that they are right.\n",

If you’re right, we’ll work together to make things better.  If you’re wrong, I’ll still admit that you’re better-educated, more attractive, more innovative, etc. than I am.  We’ll both be better off.\n",
