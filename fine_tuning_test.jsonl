That is, do our collective choices go wrong mainly because we make a few key mistakes in choosing particular policies? Or do they go wrong mainly because we use the wrong institutions to choose these policies?I would have thought meta-policy was the obvious answer. But CATO asked 51 scholars\/pundits this question:If you could wave a magic wand and make one or two policy or institutional changes to brighten the U.S. economy\u2019s long-term growth prospects, what would you change and why?And out of the 29 answers now visible, only four (or 14%) of us picked meta-policy changes:Michael Strain says to increase fed data agency budgets:BLS data on gross labor market flows \u2026 are not available at the state and MSA level, they do not have detailed industry breakdowns, and they do not break down by occupation or by job task. \u2026 We also need better \u201clongitudinal\u201d data \u2014 data that track individuals every year (or even more frequently) for a long period of time. \u2026 The major federal statistical agencies need larger budgets to collect the data we need to design policies to increase workforce participation and to strength future growth. \u2026 My second policy suggestion is to expand the \u2026 EITC.Lee Drutman says to increase Congress staff policy budgets:I would triple the amount the Congress spends on staff (keeping it still at just under 0.1% of the total federal budget). I\u2019d also concentrate that spending in the policy committees. I\u2019d give those committees the resources to be leading institutions for expertise on the issues on which they deal. I\u2019d also give these committees the resources to hire their own experts \u2014 economists, lawyers, consultants, etc. But I\u2019d also make sure that these committees were not explicitly partisan.Eli Dourado says to pay Congress a bonus if the economy does well:A performance bonus would help to overcome some of Congress\u2019s complacency and division in the face of decades-long economic stagnation. \u2026 One good performance metric would be total factor productivity (TFP). \u2026 Fernald adjusts his TFP estimate for cyclical labor and capital utilization changes, making his series a better measure. \u2026 Members of Congress would earn a $200,000 bonus if the two-year period in which they serve averages 2 percent TFP growth. (more)Robin Hanson says to use decisions markets to choose policies:First, I propose that our national legislatures pass bills to define national welfare, and fund and authorize an agency to collect statistics to measure this numerical quantity after the fact. \u2026 Second, \u2026 create an open bounty system for proposing policies to increase national welfare. \u2026 Third, \u2026 create two open speculative decision markets for each official proposal, to estimate national welfare given that we do or do not adopt this proposal. \u2026 If over the decision day the average if-adopted price is higher than the average if-not-adopt price (plus average bid-ask spread), then the proposal \u2026 becomes a new law of the land.It seems to me that Michael, Lee, and Eli feel wave pretty weak wands. Surely if they thought their wands strong enough to cast any policy or meta-policy spell, wouldn\u2019t they pick meta-policy spells a bit stronger than these? (And why is it always more spending, not less?)By focusing on policy instead of meta-policy, it seems to me that the other 25 writers show either an unjustified faith in existing policy institutions, or a lack of imagination on possible alternatives. Both of which are somewhat surprising for 51 scholars chosen by CATO.Added Dec3:  3 of the 25 remaining proposals were in the meta-policy direction:Susan Dudley:[Regulatory] agencies should be required to present evidence that they have identified a material failure of competitive markets or public institutions that requires a federal regulatory solution, and provide an objective evaluation of alternatives.Michael Mandel:The Regulatory Improvement Commission \u2026 would have a limited period of time to come up with a package of regulations to be eliminated or fixed, drawing on public suggestions. The package would then be sent to Congress for an up-or-down vote, and then onto the President for signing.Megan McArdle:Instead of analyzing whether the [cost-benefit] calculations in a regulatory ledger sum to a positive or a negative number, we need to set a level of [regulatory] complexity that we\u2019re willing to live with, and then decide which positive sum regulations we\u2019re willing to discard in order to stay within that budget. \u2026 Crude rules which might well serve, like capping the number of laws and regulations, allowing a new one to be implemented only if an older one is repealed.Added 30Sept2015: There are now 51 of these proposals, collected into a book. I found no more that are plausibly meta-proposals.","1":" The Ems of Altered Carbon  People keep suggesting that I can\u2019t possibly present myself as an expert on the future if I\u2019m not familiar with their favorite science fiction (sf). I say that sf mostly pursues other purposes and rarely tries much to present realistic futures. But I figure should illustrate my claim with concrete examples from time to time. Which brings us to Altered Carbon, a ten episode sf series just out on Netflix, based on a 2002 novel. I\u2019ve watched the series, and read the novel and its two sequels.Altered Carbon\u2019s key tech premise is a small \u201cstack\u201d which can sit next to a human brain collecting and continually updating a digital representation of that brain\u2019s full mental state. This state can also be transferred into the rest of that brain, copied to other stacks, or placed and run in an android body or a virtual reality. Thus stacks allow something much like ems who can move between bodies.But the universe of Altered Carbon looks very different from my description of the Age of Em. Set many centuries in future, our descendants have colonized many star systems. Technological change then is very slow; someone revived after sleeping for centuries is familiar with almost all the tech they see, and they remain state-of-the-art at their job. While everyone is given a stack as a baby, almost all jobs are done by ordinary humans, most of whom are rather poor and still in their original body, the only body they\u2019ll ever have. Few have any interest in living in virtual reality, which is shown as cheap, comfortable, and realistic; they\u2019d rather die. There\u2019s also little interest in noticeably-non-human android bodies, which could plausibly be pretty cheap.Regarding getting new very-human-like physical bodies, some have religious objections, many are disinterested, but most are just too poor. So most stacks are actually never used. Stacks can insure against accidents that kill a body but don\u2019t hurt the stack. Yet while it should be cheap and easy to backup stack data periodically, inexplicibly only rich folks do that.It is very illegal for one person to have more than one stack running at a time. Crime is often punished by taking away the criminal\u2019s body, which creates a limited supply of bodies for others to rent. Very human-like clone and android bodies are also available, but are very expensive. Over the centuries some have become very rich and long-lived \u201cmeths\u201d, paying for new bodies as needed. Meths run everything, and are shown as inhumanly immoral, often entertaining themselves by killing poor people, often via sex acts. Our hero was once part of a failed revolution to stop meths via a virus that kills anyone with a century of subjective experience.Oh, and there have long been fully human level AIs who are mainly side characters that hardly matter to this world. I\u2019ll ignore them, as criticizing the scenario on these grounds is way too easy.Now my analysis says that there\u2019d be an enormous economic demand for copies of ems, who can do most all jobs via virtual reality or android bodies. If very human-like physical bodies are too expensive, the economy would just skip them. If allowed, ems would quickly take over all work, most activity would be crammed in a few dense cities, and the economy could double monthly. Yet while war is common in the universe of Altered Carbon, and spread across many star systems, no place ever adopts the huge winning strategy of unleashing such an em economy and its associated military power. While we see characters who seek minor local advantages get away for long times with violating the rule against copying, no one ever tries to do this to get vastly rich, or to win a war. No one even seems aware of the possibility.Even ignoring the AI bit, I see no minor modification to make this into a realistic future scenario. It is made more to be a morality play, to help you feel righteous indignation at those damn rich folks who think they can just live forever by working hard and saving their money over centuries. If there are ever poor humans who can\u2019t afford to live forever in very human-like bodies, even if they could easily afford android or virtual immortality, well then both the rich and the long-lived should all burn! So you can feel morally virtuous watching hour after hour of graphic sex and violence toward that end. As it so happens that hand-to-hand combat, typically producing big spurts of blood, and often among nudes, is how most conflicts get handled in this universe. Enjoy!","2":" Social Scientists Know Lots  For me, the year\u2019s best reading is usually the many thoughtful answers to The Edge\u2018s annual question.  This year they ask:What have you changed your mind about?  Why?I\u2019d love to hang out with these folks, so maybe I should audition.  My answer:Social scientists know lots.As a physics student and computer science researcher, I assimilated the usual \u201chard science\u201d perception that \u201csocial science\u201d is an oxymoron \u2014 no one knows much about it, so your opinion is as good as anyone\u2019s.  When I finally decided I needed social science credentials, to turn my institution hobby into a career, I focused on experimental economics, the only sort a hard scientist could trust, and Caltech, with impeccable hard science credentials.  But I was soon thoroughly convinced: social scientists know tons.Why then do so many people think otherwise?  Many say it is because social scientists are stupid, or the social world is too complex or uncontrollable.  Better answers are that social expertise conflicts with our overconfidence about familiar experience, or with our democratic ideology that everyone\u2019s political opinions should get equal weight.  But the best answer, I think is that most public talk by social experts reflects little social science.  That is, what social experts say in legal or congressional testimony, or in newspapers or magazines, mostly reflects what they and we want and expect to hear, instead of what expert evidence reveals.For an analogy, consider the lives of a distant isolated group, like Al Qaeda or devil worshipers.  If most of us had strong emotional preconceptions, or if many advocates wanted us to have certain opinions about them, then we might not be able to believe much of what we heard about this group.  That is, we might not have cheap and effective ways to distinguish honest reports from those driven by other agendas.  This would not imply that no one knows anything about this distant group; insiders there surely know, for example.Similarly, social scientists have data and theory giving powerful insight into a great many social issues, at least to those with open minds.  Open minded social scientists talking privately can make great intellectual progress.  But powerful forces are eager to distort the messages social scientists give the public on important topics. Academics with deserved reputations for careful accurate work on obscure academic topics tend to adopt different standards when writing editorials or advising politicians.  Even if most academics would not do this, those selected for such roles usually do.This effect is a good reason for \u201cintellectual travel,\u201d to see many topics for yourself up close.  Also, a mechanism that could cut through this fog and tell the public what honest social scientists really think might have great social value, at least if the public could be shamed into listening to them.  This is one of my great hopes for prediction markets.","3":" When Does Evidence Win?  Consider a random area of intellectual inquiry, and a random intellectual who enters this area. When this person first arrives, a few different points of view seemed worthy of consideration in this area. This person then becomes expert enough to favor one of these views. Then over the following years and decades the intellectual world comes to more strongly favor one of these views, relative to the others. My key question is: in what situations do such earlier arrivals, on average, tend to approve of this newly favored position?Now there will be many cases where favoring a point helps people to be seen an intellectual of a certain standing. For example, jumping on an intellectual fashion could help one to better publish, and then get tenure. So if we look at tenured professors, we might well see that they tended to favor new fashions. To exclude this effect, I want to apply whatever standard is used to pick intellectuals before they choose their view on this area.There will also be an effect whereby intellectuals move their work to focus on new areas even if they don\u2019t actually think they are favored by the weight of evidence. (By \u201cevidence\u201d here I also mean to include relevant intellectual arguments.) So I don\u2019t want to rely on the areas where people work to judge which areas they favor. I instead need something more like a survey that directly asks intellectuals which views they honestly think are favored by the weight of evidence. And I need this survey to be private enough for respondents to not fear retribution or disapproval for expressed views. (And I also want them to be intellectually honest in this situation.)Once we are focused on people who were already intellectuals of some standing when they choose their views in an area, and on their answers to a private enough survey, I want to further distinguish between areas where relevant strong and clear evidence did or did not arrive. Strong evidence favors one of the views substantially, and clear evidence can be judged and understood by intellectuals at the margins of the field, such as those in neighboring fields or with less intellectual standing. These can included students, reporters, grant givers, and referees.In my personal observation, when strong and clear evidence arrives, the weight of opinion does tend to move toward the views favored by this evidence. And early arrivals to the field also tend to approve. Yes many such intellectuals will continue to favor their initial views because the rise of other views tends to cut the perceived value of their contributions. But averaging over people with different views, on net opinion moves to favor the view that evidence favors.However, the effectiveness of our intellectual world depends greatly on what happens in the other case, where relevant evidence is not clear and strong. Instead, evidence is weak, so that one must weigh many small pieces of evidence, and evidence is complex, requiring much local expertise to judge and understand. If even in this case early arrivals to a field tend to approve of new favored opinions, that (weakly) suggests that opinion is in fact moved by the information embodied in this evidence, even when it is weak and complex. But if not, that fact (weakly) suggests that opinion moves are mostly due to many other random factors, such as new political coalitions within related fields.While I\u2019ve outlined how one might do a such a survey, I have not actually done it. Even so, over the years I have formed opinions on areas where my opinions did not much influence my standing as an intellectual, and where strong and clear evidence has not yet arrived. Unfortunately, in those areas I have not seen much of a correlation between the views I see as favored on net by weak and complex evidence, and the views that have since become more popular. Sometimes fashion favors my views, and sometimes not.In fact, most who choose newly fashionable views seem unaware of the contrary arguments against those views and for other views. Advocates for new views usually don\u2019t mention them and few potential converts ask for them. Instead what matters most is: how plausible does the evidence for a view offered by its advocates seem to those who know little about the area. I see far more advertising than debate.This suggests that most intellectual progress should be attributed to the arrival of strong and clear evidence. Other changes in intellectual opinion are plausibly due to a random walk in the space of other random factors. As a result, I have prioritized my search for strong and clear evidence on interesting questions. And I\u2019m much less interested than I once was in weighing the many weak and complex pieces of evidence in other areas. Even if I can trust myself to judge such evidence honestly, I have little faith in my ability to persuade the world to agree.Yes if you weigh such weak and complex evidence, you might come to a conclusion, argue for it, and find a world that increasingly agrees with you. And you might let your self then believe that you are in a part of the intellectual world with real and useful intellectual progress, progress to which you have contributed. Which would feel nice. But you should consider the possibility that this progress is illusory. Maybe for real progress, you need to instead chip away at hard problems, via strong and clear evidence.","4":" Shared AI Wins  Almost every new technology comes at first in a dizzying variety of styles, and then converges to what later seems the \"obvious\" configuration.  It is actually quite an eye-opener to go back and see old might-have-beens, from steam-powered cars to pneumatic tube mail to Memex to Englebart\u2019s computer tools.  Techs that are only imagined, not implemented, take on the widest range of variations.  When actual implementations appear, people slowly figure out what works better, while network and other scale effects lock-in popular approaches.  As standards congeal, competitors focus on smaller variations around accepted approaches.  Those who stick with odd standards tend to be marginalized. Eliezer says standards barriers are why AIs would \"foom\" locally, with one AI quickly growing from so small no one notices, to so powerful it takes over the world:I also don\u2019t think this [scenario] is allowed: \u2026 knowledge and even skills are widely traded in this economy of AI systems. In concert, these AIs, and their human owners, and the economy that surrounds them, undergo a collective FOOM of self-improvement.  No local agent is capable of doing all this work, only the collective system. \u2026  [The reason is that] trading cognitive content around between diverse AIs is more difficult and less likely than it might sound.  Consider the field of AI as it works today.  Is there any standard database of cognitive content that you buy off the shelf and plug into your amazing new system, whether it be a chessplayer or a new data-mining algorithm? \u2026The diversity of cognitive architectures acts as a tremendous barrier to trading around cognitive content. \u2026 If two AIs both see an apple for the first time, and they both independently form concepts about that apple \u2026 their thoughts are effectively written in a different language. \u2026 The barrier this opposes to a true, cross-agent, literal \"economy of mind\", is so strong, that in the vast majority of AI applications you set out to write today, you will not bother to import any standardized preprocessed cognitive content.  It will be easier for your AI application to start with some standard examples \u2013 databases of that sort of thing do exist, in some fields anyway \u2013 and redo all the cognitive work of learning on its own. \u2026  Looking over the diversity of architectures proposed at any AGI conference I\u2019ve attended, it is very hard to imagine directly trading cognitive content between any two of them.But of course \"visionaries\" take a wide range of incompatible approaches. Commercial software tries much harder to match standards and share sources.  The whole point of CYC was that AI researchers neglect compatibility and sharing because they are more interested in writing papers than making real systems.  The idea that you could create human level intelligence by just feeding raw data into the right math-inspired architecture is pure fantasy.  You couldn\u2019t build an effective cell or ecosystem or developed economy or most any complex system that way either \u2013 such things require not just good structure but also lots of good content.  Loners who start all over from scratch rarely beat established groups sharing enough standards to let them share improvements to slowly accumulate content.   CYC content may or may not jump-start a sharing AI community, but AI just won\u2019t happen without a whole lot of content.  If ems appear first, perhaps shareable em contents could form a different basis for shared improvements.","5":" Are UFOs Aliens?  I\u2019m a social scientist with a high estimate of the power of social science (especially economics and sociobiology) to trace the outlines of a wide variety of social behavior.  I even use social science to estimate our distant descendants\u2019 future, and the astronomical signatures that aliens might leave.Some complain that such efforts reflect an overconfidence in social science, that academic insights today have little power to generalize to such distant situations.  Some even say social science does not exist, i.e., that it fails to offer much insight even into human society today.  But most of these social science skeptics also want to say we are pretty sure UFOs are not aliens \u2013 that aliens are not regularly visiting Earth today.  And during a long drive from DC to Indianapolis and back with Bill and Chris Dickens (to attend GenCon), I realized this is contradictory: social science is our main theoretical basis for thinking no UFOs are aliens!Humans have long reported various rare and odd phenomena, from angels to faeries to bigfoot to sea monsters to ghosts.  We are pretty sure most such \"weird\" reports are errors, i.e., mistakes, frauds, or misunderstandings.  We also reasonably believe most weird report categories are entirely errors  \u2014 for example, we reasonably believe all faery reports are errors. Nevertheless, we can\u2019t be especially confident that a category of weird reports is all error, merely because it is weird.  After all, some weird categories have been vindicated, i.e., we now think many reports really were as weird as claimed.  Meteorite reports, for example, were once thought to be crazy \u2013 why the heck would rocks fall from the sky?  I\u2019d love for someone to survey categories of weird reports made a few centuries ago, identifying the categories most clearly settled by now, and seeing what fraction of settled categories have been vindicated.  My guess would be roughly 5%.Coming back to UFOs as aliens, if all we knew about this report category was that it is weird, we would have to assign roughly a 5% chance that some UFOs really are aliens.  And given such a dramatic conclusion, a lot of UFO research would then be justified.  So do we know something more about UFO reports, to let us adjust this 5% estimate?Some are impressed by the wide range and sometimes high prestige of folks who make UFO reports.  And perhaps an analysis of historically vindicated weird reports would show these to be positive indicators. But it seems to me that the main correction we apply is theoretical: we think it quite theoretically implausible that any UFOs are aliens. But why exactly is that implausible?  Since the universe is thirteen billion years old while human civilization is only a few thousand years old, alien civilizations out there would most likely be millions and perhaps billions of years more advanced than us.  Given such a lead, it is quite plausible they could make devices able to display all of the phenomena reported for UFOs.  There is nothing in physics that suggests UFOs are not aliens.No, the main argument against UFOs as aliens is that this is an implausible social scenario. People ask: why would aliens travel for light-years merely to squash some corn fields?  Why wouldn\u2019t they introduce themselves to those in power?  Why haven\u2019t they made more of a visible mark on our planet or solar system? These are fine questions, and I do agree that they tend to support a more skeptical conclusion.  (Though even I can\u2019t see how the chance goes much below 1%, still justifying substantial UFO research.)  But my main point is that such skepticism is only reasonable if we actually know enough social science (broadly conceived) to be able to say something about alien behavior.  And if we know this much social science, we should also be able to make some progress using social science to estimate our distant descendants\u2019 future, and the astronomical signatures of distant aliens.You can\u2019t have it both ways: you can\u2019t say we know too little social science to project our distant future and distant alien astronomical signatures, but we do know enough social science to be confident UFOs are not aliens.","6":" Med Media Mangle  The media holds medicine to a lower standard than it holds alternative medicine, such as say crystal healing. No way would an article in a major paper complain that we aren\u2019t subsidizing crystals enough for poor folks, based on the observation that rich folks buy more crystals and rich folks are healthier. But for medicine, that sort of correlation is enough.For example, this week the Post has not one but two long articles celebrating a new breast cancer study, which it says shows:\u201cNearly five black women die needlessly per day from breast cancer\u201d because they don\u2019t have information about the importance of breast screening and they don\u2019t have access to high quality care.But in fact, the study shows only that across 25 US cities, the ratio of the black vs. white breast cancer death rates correlates (barely significantly) with median city income and a measure of city racial segregation. It is a huge leap to conclude from these correlations that black women don\u2019t have enough info or care!The very robust health-status correlation predicts more health for higher status folks, and thus more race-health disparity when there is a higher race-status disparity. It seem quite plausible that the race-status disparity is higher in cities where races are segregated and incomes are low.More from the Post:It would be nearly nine months before she told herself it was time to act. By then, the lump was the size of a small egg. \u2026 Doctors and advocates say the fear that kept her from acting quickly is all too common among black women. It is among the factors that contribute to a disturbing trend: Although they are less likely than white women to get breast cancer, black women are more likely to die from it. \u2026 Poverty and racial inequities are the primary factors driving the disparity, according to a study. \u2026 The study, which compared mortality rates between black and white women in the nation\u2019s 25 largest cities, states that \u201cnearly five black women die needlessly per day from breast cancer\u201d because they don\u2019t have information about the importance of breast screening and they don\u2019t have access to high quality care. The authors \u2026 said genetics play only a small role in the disparity.More from the study:[In] the 25 largest cities in the US, \u2026 non-Hispanic Black : non-Hispanic White [breast cancer death] rate ratios (RRs) were calculated \u2026 Almost all the NHB rates were greater than almost all the NHW rates. \u2026 From among the 7 potential correlates, only median household income (r = 0.43, p = 0.037) and a measure of segregation (r = 0.42, p = 0.039) were signi\ufb01cantly related to the RR.Note that white women may seem to \u201cget\u201d more breast cancer because they are tested more often for it.","7":" Come The Em Rev  China on Friday unveiled a shake-up of the way land is seized for redevelopment. \u2026 Land seizures over the past decade have been central to the rapid modernization of hundreds of Chinese cities, which in turn has been one of the main drivers of the nation\u2019s economic growth. But they also have been the source of often-violent conflicts, especially in the past year, as huge volumes of stimulus funds have gone into building projects.  PostRich stable nations, comfortable and safe on top of the global game, feel little inclination to consider big disruptive changes.  The price they pay for internal peace is the steady accumulation of Olsonian veto groups, who can block big changes.  Stable inflexible institutions seem acceptable when change is slow and life seem good enough.This frustrates rich-nation would-be-rebels like me who see our business, legal, political, etc. institutions as far from optimal.  Such rebels want to explore big changes, but must either: 1) accept only tinkering around the edges, 2) move to a place more willing to make changes, or 3) wait for crises where larger changes might fly.So what crises loom?  In the US we can expect the long foreseen budget \u201ctrain wreck\u201d within a decade or two.  This must be addressed by huge tax increases, spending decreases, or both.  Foresighted politicians are positioning their blame and solutions for that crisis.  Since we spend so much on military and medical benefits, I\u2019ve wondered if we\u2019ll consider \u201cMed is a waste, cut it way back\u201d or \u201cLet the world defend itself, cut our military.\u201d Alas, neither seems likely.In two to five decades, the US will probably start to take seriously global competition from big fast growing nations like China or India.  The US might then consider adopting policies credited with growing those nations fast, though national pride may block that.  Foresighted advocates will position their credit and solutions for that crisis.But if you lust after huge institutional change in long-rich nations, if you long to say \u201ccome the revolution,\u201d you might wait three to fifteen decades for the \u201cem rev\u201c, the whole brain emulation revolution.  The em rev is my best guess for the next \u201csingularity\u201d scale change, like the farming or industrial revolutions, each of which sped world growth rates by more than a factor of a hundred, within less than a previous doubling time.  We now double in fifteen years, so within a few years an em-econ could double monthly!Achieving such rapid growth will require huge rapid changes in economic organization, and supporting changes to business, legal, and political institutions. The new em-econ will probably concentrate in a few dense locations with the most compatible capital and institutions.  Locations vying to be one of those centers may be open to big institutional change, and the actual first centers will likely have relatively supportive institutions. So if you have a favorite radical change you\u2019d like the world to consider, you might give some thought to how your change could support a local em rev.Now an ambitious dictator, especially an em dictator, may have the power and flexibility to quickly make whatever changes the em rev needs, even if that harms other existing local interests.  So the real question is what other institutions could also quickly discern and approve needed changes, while less harming those who happen to stand in the way.While the em-econ should have be felt most everywhere, it would concentrate at first in a few most em-dominated places.  Those places would have a huge demand for computing hardware, for fast talk between that hardware, and for energy and cooling to support that computing and talk.  Imagine the computing hardware now concentrated near major financial markets, but on a much larger scale.The em-econ would likely take over and dramatically reorganize some major city centers, replacing humans with increasingly human-hostile temperatures, vibrations, radiation, collision dangers, free chemical densities, etc.  Imagine a hot bustling dangerous factory.  Those centers would seek very rapid growth in local power and cooling, perhaps via fusion power and huge pipes pumping hot water far out to sea.  Nearby air and water may be severely \u201cpolluted\u201d by current standards.To support an em-econ, institutions must first and foremost enable very rapid change.  Waiting years for regulatory review or lawsuits, or even months for firm or city council negotiations, is completely unacceptable.  If humans are to have a say in key decisions, they must make fast decisions or delegate to fast agents.To discourage grab-from-humans scenarios, human and em property, investments, etc. should ideally be protected via exactly the same institutions, so that a threat to one is plausibly a threat to the other.  And if ems are to be treated with near human respect, we\u2019ll need huge changes in common rules like one person one vote, which em copies are responsible for which crimes, what are acceptable labor and marriage contracts, etc.Three big institution changes seem to me promising em rev candidates:Firm: Raiders \u2013 If we lower barriers to taking over firms, and let takeovers happen very quickly, public firms could quickly adapt to changing conditions.  Internal futarchy might also help.Law: Private \u2013 With a basic legal structure that lets parties commit to their own legal rules and procedures, ems could adopt much faster legal procedures and explore the space of more em-suitable laws.Politics: Futarchy \u2013 The vote on values part can be slow and accountable to a wider world of nervous slow marginals, while the bet on beliefs part could rapidly approve needed changes.","8":" Forager v Farmer, Elaborated  Seven years ago, after a year of reading up on forager lives, I first started to explore a forager vs. farmer axis:A lot of today\u2019s political disputes come down to a conflict between farmer and forager ways, with forager ways slowly and steadily winning out since the industrial revolution. It seems we acted like farmers when farming required that, but when richer we feel we can afford to revert to more natural-feeling forager ways. The main exceptions, like school and workplace domination and ranking, are required to generate industry-level wealth. (more)Recently I decided to revisit the idea, to see if I could find a clearer story that accounts better for many related patterns. Here is what I\u2019ve come up with.Our primate ancestors lived in a complex Machiavellian social world, with many nested levels of allies each coordinating to oppose outside rival groups of allies, often via violence. Humans, however, managed to collapse most of those levels into one: what Boehm has called a \u201creverse dominance hierarchy.\u201d Human bands were mostly on good terms with neighboring bands, who they met infrequently. Inside each band, the whole group used weapons and language to coordinate to enforce shared social norms, to create a peaceful egalitarian safe space.Individuals who saw a norm violation could tell others, and then the whole band could discuss what to do about it. Once a consensus formed, the band could use weapons to enforce their collective decision. As needed, punishments could escalate from scolding to shunning to exile to death. Common norms included requirements to share food and protection, and bans on violence, giving orders, bragging, and creating subgroup factions.This worked often, but not always. People retained general Machiavellian social abilities, and usually used them covertly, just out of view of group norm enforcement. But sometimes the power of the collective waned, and then many would switch to acting more overtly Machiavellian. For example, an individual or a pair of allies might become so powerful that they could openly defy the group\u2019s disapproval. Or such a pair might violate norms semi-privately, and use a threat of strong retaliation to dissuade others from openly decrying their violations. Or a nearby rival group might threaten to attack. Or a famine or flood might threaten mass mortality.In the absence of such threats, the talky collective was the main arena that mattered. Everyone worked hard to look good by the far-view idealistic and empathy-based norms usually favored in collective views. They behaved well when observed, learned to talk persuasively to the group, and made sure to have friends to watch and talk for them. They expressed their emotions, and acted like they cared about others.When they felt on good terms with the group, people could relax and feel safe. They then become more playful, and acted like animals generally do when playful. Within a bounded safe space, behavior becomes more varied, stylized, artistic, humorous, teasing, self-indulgent, and emotionally expressive. For example, there is more, and more varied, music and dance. New possibilities are explored.A feeling of safety includes feeling safe to form more distinct subgroups, without others seeing such subgroups as threatening factions. And that includes feeling safe to form groups that tend to argue together for similar positions within talky collective discussions, and to disagree with the larger group. After all, it is hard for a talky collective to function well unless members are allowed to openly disagree with one another.But when the group was stressed and threatened by dominators, outsiders, or famine, the collective view mattered less, and people reverted to more general Machiavellian social strategies. Then it mattered more who had what physical resources and strength, and what personal allies. People leaned toward projecting toughness instead of empathy. And they demanded stronger signals of loyalty, such as conformity, and were more willing to suspect people of disloyalty. Subgroups and non-conformity became more suspect, including subgroups that consistently argued together for unpopular positions.And here is the key idea: individuals vary in the thresholds they use to switch between focusing on dealing with issues via an all-encompassing norm-enforcing talky collective, and or via general Machiavellian social skills, mediated by personal resources and allies. Everyone tends to switch together to a collective focus as the environment becomes richer and safer. (This is one of the many ways that behaviors and values consistently change with wealth.) But some switch sooner: those better at working the collective, such as being better at talking and empathy, and those who gain more from collective choices, such as physically weaker folks who can\u2019t hunt or gather as well. And also people just generally less prone to feeling afraid as a result of ambiguous cues.People who feel less safe are more afraid of changing whatever has worked in the past, and so hold on more tightly to typical past behaviors and practices. They are more worried about the group damaging the talky collective, via tolerating free riders, allowing more distinct subgroups, and by demanding too much from members who might just up and leave. Also, those who feel less able to influence communal discussions prefer groups norms to be enforced more simply and mechanically, without as many exceptions that will be more influenced by those who are good at talking.I argue that this key \u201cleft vs. right\u201d inclination to focus more vs less on a talky collective is the main parameter that consistently determines who people tend to ally with in large scale political coalitions. Other parameters can matter a lot in different times and places, but this is the one that consistently matters. This parameter doesn\u2019t matter much for how individuals relate to each other personally, and at smaller social scales like clubs or firms, coalitions form more via our general Machiavellian abilities, based on parameters than matter directly in those contexts. But everyone has an intuitive sense for how much we all expect and want big issues to be handled by a talky collective of \u201ceveryone\u201d with any power. The first and primary political question is how much to try to resolve issues via a big talky collective, or to let smaller groups decide for themselves.This account that I\u2019ve just outline does reasonably well at accounting for many known left-right patterns. For example, the right is more conscientious, while the left is more open to experience. The left prefers more varied niche types of sports, movies, and music, while the right prefers fewer standardized types. Artists, musicians, and comedians tend to be on the left. Right sports focus more on physical strength and combat, stronger men have stronger political opinions, and when low status they favor more redistribution. People on the right are less reflective, prefer simpler arguments, are more sensitive to disgust, and startle more easily.Education elites are more left than business elites. In romance and spirituality, the left tends to favor authentic feelings while the right cares more about standards of behavior. The left is more spiritual while right is more religious. Left jobs focused more on talking and on a high tail of great outcomes, while right jobs focus more on avoiding a low tail of bad outcomes.The left is more okay with people forming distinct subgroups, even as it thinks more in terms of treating everyone equally, even across very wide scopes, and including wide scopes in more divisive debates. The right wants to make redistribution more conditional, more wants to punish free riders, and wants norm violators to be more consistently punished. The left tends to presume large scale cooperation is feasible, while right tends to presume competition more. The left hopes for big gains from change while the right worries about change damaging things that now work.Views tend to drift leftward as nations and the world get richer. Left versus right isn\u2019t very useful for predicting individual behavior outside of politics, even as it is the main parameter that robustly determines large scale political inclinations. People tend to think differently about politics on what they see as the largest scales; for example, there are whole separate fields of political science and political philosophy, which don\u2019t overlap much with fields dealing with smaller scale politics, such as in clubs and firms.I shouldn\u2019t need to say it but I will anyway: it is obvious that a safe playful talky collective is sometimes but not always the best way to deal with things. Its value varies with context. So sometimes those who are more reluctant to invoke it are right to be wary, while at other times those who are eager to apply it are right to push for it. It is not obvious, at least to me, whether on average the instincts of the left or the right are more helpful.I\u2019ve noted before that if one frames left attitudes as better when the world is safe, while right attitudes as better when world is harsh, the longer is the timescale on which you evaluate outcomes, the harsher is the world.Added 9Sept: This post didn\u2019t say much directly about farmers. In the much larger farmer social groups, simple one layer talky collectives were much less feasible. Farmer lives had new dangers of war and disease, and neighboring groups were more threatening. The farmer world more supported property in spouses and material goods and had more social hierarchies, farmer law less relied on a general discussion of each accused, and more reliable food meant there was less call for redistribution. Farmers worked more and had less time for play.  Together, these tended to reduce the scope of safe playful talky collectives, moving society in a rightward direction relative to foragers.","9":" Paying For Med Quality  Some hope to cut US med spending, and raise med quality, by paying more for higher quality outcomes. But this doesn\u2019t work so well if the people you pay are also in charge of telling you the outcomes. Or if you must prove that their care caused bad outcomes, instead of being due to especially weak\/sick patients. I have high hopes for a system that paid for med outcomes determined by independent third parties, where price competition for specific patients could deal with patient selection issues. But I\u2019m pretty skeptical that the US govt will allow that:Medicare has begun publishing the rates of complications as a step toward using them to set payment rates for thousands of hospitals. But leaders of a number of the nation\u2019s prestigious teaching hospitals are objecting \u2026A central tenet of the 2010 federal health-care law will tie Medicare reimbursement to a variety of measures, including how patients rate their stays, readmission, mortality rates and how closely hospitals adhere to basic guidelines for care. \u2026 Officials at many of the hospitals listed as having high rates of complications say the measures are fundamentally skewed in ways that exaggerate problems at hospitals that treat many complicated cases or very sick patients. \u2026Hospital officials examined the cases that led Medicare to rate her hospital as having a high rate of accidental cuts and lacerations. They found most of those cuts had been intended by the surgeon, but erroneously billed to Medicare under the code for an accidental cut. \u2026 \u201cThese patient safety indicators, they\u2019re not real\u00adly well risk-adjusted.\u201d \u2026Medicare identified 190 of 3,330 hospitals as having very high levels. Of those, 82 were major teaching hospitals, \u2026 Cleveland Clinic, said the clinic\u2019s high rates of accidental tears and lacerations and serious blood clots were because \u201cpeople are careful at documenting, almost to a fault, things that are incidental to the case.\u201d \u2026 Gregg Meyer \u2026 predicted that many hospitals will react to the publication of the patient safety data by instructing those who fill out the billing records to change what they include, or by lavishing staff attention on the areas flagged by Medicare even if they aren\u2019t a real problem.

And while over the years I\u2019ve often struggled to think of ways to raise the rate of innovation, it seems much easier to find ways to cut it; in general, it is easier to break things than improve them.For example, we might press on one of our legal system\u2019s key flaws. Today, law does far more to discourage A from harming B than to encourage A to help B. B can often sue A for compensation when A harms B, but A can rarely sue B for compensation when A helped B. Law. Today is mostly a system of brakes, not of engines or accelerators.This is less of a problem for auto accidents or pandemics, where the most important effects of the most important actions are indeed harms. But it is a much bigger problem in innovation, where the main problem is too little incentive to help. In general, society gains far more from innovations than do the people who push for them. So innovation needs engines, not brakes.The problem is that even events whose effects are overall beneficial will still have some harmful effects. For example, if you invent a new better mousetrap, you may displace previous mousetrap makers. Or by introducing cars, you may hurt people who supplied or managed horses. So what if our legal system makes it easier to sue people for the harms caused by their innovations?For example, many have complained lately of negative effects of social media, such as increasing anxiety, decreasing privacy, and passing on \u201cfake\u201d news. And just as legal liability has been a big weapon in recent campaigns against harms from tobacco and pain-killers, liability may well also become a big weapon against social media. Wielded especially strongly against those who have most innovated and developed social media.Imagine that holding innovators liable for the negative effects of their innovations became more widespread. But without increasing the rewards we allow to innovators for the benefits that they bestow. Together with the trend to increased regulation, this might just become enough to kill the innovation goose that lays our golden egg of growth.","11":" Socialism Via Futarchy  On Bryan\u2019s recommendation, I just read Niemietz\u2019s Socialism: The Failed Idea That Never Dies, which credibly argues that two dozen socialism experiments over the last century have consistently failed, with roughly this pattern:The not-real-socialism defence is only ever invoked retrospectively, namely, when a socialist experiment has already been widely discredited. As long as a socialist experiment is in its prime, almost nobody disputes its socialist credentials. On the contrary: practically all socialist regimes have gone through honeymoon periods, during which they were enthusiastically praised and held up as role models by plenty of prominent Western intellectuals. (More)Noteworthy results from the latest experiment:The number of worker-run cooperatives increased from fewer than 1,000 when Ch\u00e1vez was first elected to well over 30,000 in less than a decade. By the end of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s second term, cooperatives accounted for about 8% of Venezuela\u2019s GDP and 14% of its workforce \u2026 It soon became clear \u2026 that many cooperatives were behaving like capitalist enterprises, seeking to maximize their net revenue \u2026 For example, rather than supplying their products to local markets \u2026 export them to other countries where they can sell them at higher prices \u2026 Also, many cooperatives have refrained from accepting new members. \u2026 As Ch\u00e1vez himself said: \u2026 if we are 20 in a cooperative, we are going to work for the benefit of us 20, and that is merely capitalism. Cooperatives need to be impelled towards socialism.\u2019 (More)Even after so many very expensive experiments, they still apparently have only have the vaguest idea of what detailed arrangements might actually achieve what they want. It seems they have mainly waited until an allied group gained control somewhere, and then tried a few random variations that resonate with local supporters.There still seems to be great passion in the world for further socialism experiments, but it seems hard to hold much hope if they continue with this pattern. While I\u2019m not personally very inspired by the socialist vision, I do like for people to get what they want, and that includes people who want socialism. So I\u2019m taking the time to think about how to help them get it.Which induces me to consider variations on futarchy to help to achieve socialism. If you recall, futarchy is a form of governance wherein market speculators choose policies to maximize an ex-post-measured welfare measure. The thicker are these markets (perhaps via subsidies), the stronger are the incentives for speculators to learn what is actually effective in achieving that welfare. This seems a good match, if what socialism most needs now is less a good system and more a good learning environment in which to search for good systems.The big question for futarchy-based socialism is: what are the ex-post-measurable outcomes that indicate a successful socialism? That is, how would you know one when you saw it? Obviously you\u2019d want to include some basic consumption measures, like G.D.P., but if that\u2019s all you maximize there\u2019s no obvious reason why the result will be especially socialist. You might include risk-aversion over consumption, which punishes inequality to some degree, but again it isn\u2019t obvious that risk-aversion greatly favors socialism. Even more directly and strong punishing inequality and emphasizing the poor doesn\u2019t obviously favor any more socialism than we see in high-redistribution low-regulation capitalist Nordic \u201csocial democracies\u201d.Consider:Socialism is \u2026 characterised by social ownership of the means of production and workers\u2019 self-management of enterprise \u2026 Social ownership can be public, collective or cooperative ownership, or citizen ownership of equity. (More)What all socialism has in common \u2026 is \u2026 bottom-up governance of society based on local assemblies which elect delegates that share their peoples\u2019 living conditions, can be overridden, answer to and are replaceable by them, who can federate into councils and repeat the process for larger areas and amounts of people. (More; see also)It seems that to many a central concept of socialism is each person having a high a degree control (also called \u201cownership\u201d) over their world, including both their immediate world and the larger economic\/political world. This is not just control to enable one to achieve high consumption, but also control over one\u2019s workplace, and probably even more control than is required for these purposes. In this view, successful socialism is a world of busybodies with strong abilities to get into each others\u2019 business.To promote socialism then, we might try a futarchy whose welfare measure includes not just measures of consumption, but also of control.For example, one measure of control would ask random people to try to induce particular random changes in their world. The stronger the correlation between actual changes afterward and the changes that we randomly assigned them, the more we\u2019d say that people in this world had a lot of control over it. But we\u2019d need to find some widely-accepted weights that say which possible changes count for how much, and we\u2019d need ways to get people to actually try to change their world in the ways we assign them. These seems hard to achieve. Also, this would probably find near zero control for larger social structures, no matter how things are arranged. And we\u2019d need to find ways to prevent this world from suddenly becoming more plastic to support test changes, while less supporting non-test changes.Also, I worry that simple-minded measures of individual control might induce many decisions to be made via big xor trees. Such trees would seem to let anyone who controls inputs to any leaf of the tree determine the root as well. Though of course in practice not being able to predict the other inputs means you can\u2019t actually usefully control the output. But can we formally define average individual control in a way that doesn\u2019t promote such xor trees?Probably the simplest solution is to just survey people about their sense of control over their world. You might want to emphasize people who\u2019ve recently visited other worlds, so they can reasonably compare their world to others. And you\u2019d want to limit the abilities of local authorities to force people to give desired survey answers, such as via the threat of retaliation. If a strong central government were part of a socialist society, that may also make it difficult to measure consumption. Such governments have been known to try to distort consumption stats to make themselves look good.One solution to these problems would be to rely on capitalist foreigners, and on travel to visit them, for both market speculators and welfare measurement.That is, let random citizens (perhaps whole families) of the socialist society be extracted periodically and made to visit a capitalist foreign land. During that foreign visit, they can be privately interviewed about both their sense of control and their consumption levels, and they can be offered the chance to stay in that foreign land. (Via offers with varying degrees of attractiveness.) Stats on what they said and on who chose to stay could then be used to estimate the welfare of that society, without allowing that socialist government to retaliate via knowing who said what. Foreign speculators could also pay to talk privately to these visitors, to help inform their market speculation choices.In this scenario, this socialist society would, to help it more quickly learn what works best, commit to delegating to these capitalist foreigners the measurement of its welfare and substantial participation in their speculative governance markets. Of course people at home within this socialist society could also be allowed to speculate in these markets, and to contribute to stats read by foreigners. But this approach avoids extreme corruption problems by making sure that foreigners can speculate, and measure welfare, in ways that are outside of the control of a perhaps powerful socialist government.Of course if this approach eventually settled on a stable solution for making a good socialist society, they might want to drop this external futarchy run by foreigners to become entirely self-governing. That would make sense if and when full self-governance became more important than faster learning about how to make socialism work.And that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ve thought for now. Of course if sufficient interest were expressed in this concept, I could put in some more thought.","12":" Space Towers  Long ago kings and empires often signaled their power via impressive buildings, such as temples, cathedrals, and pyramids.   Today, cities and corporations often similarly signal via big skyscrapers, bridges, and ships.  But for nations, the fraction of  wealth spent on a single showy construction has dramatically decreased.  Space programs serve a similar function, but don\u2019t leave such huge monuments to admire.A new Acta Astronautica article suggests this trend may reverse.  New Scientist reports:A giant inflatable tower could carry people to the edge of space without the need for a rocket, and could be completed much sooner than a cable-based space elevator, its proponents claim. \u2026 The team envisages assembling the structure from a series of modules constructed from Kevlar-polyethylene composite tubes made rigid by inflating them with a lightweight gas such as helium.To test the idea, they built a 7-metre scale model made up of six modules.  \u2026 The team [also mathematically] modelled a 15-kilometre tower made up of 100 modules, each one 150 metres tall and 230 metres in diameter, built from inflatable tubes 2 metres across. Quine estimates it would weigh about 800,000 tonnes when pressurised \u2013 around twice the weight of the world\u2019s largest supertanker. \u201cTwenty kilometres up is about as dark as outer space. You can see about 600 kilometres in any direction.\u201dThe analysis in the tech paper is solid, if preliminary.  This seems doable now. (Quotes from the paper are below.) My immediate reaction was tech lust and pride: \u201cCOOL!\u201d  Once upon a time I would have celebrated the social value of such innovations, but now I understand that while innovation in general should be praised, we probably waste too much on showy but not especially useful monuments like this.Yes, it could be used for tourism, to reduce the cost of spaceflight, and for geoengineering, but those probably won\u2019t cover its costs.  I\u2019m proud my culture seems able to do such a thing, but I\u2019ll admit my gain may come at the expense of others who look worse by comparison.  Those quotes from the paper:We propose an alternative device to provide access to the near space and space environments that utilizes a self-supporting core structure. The structure provides a \ufb01xed link between ground and near space locations enabling the transportation of equipment, personnel and other objects or people to platforms or pods above the surface of the Earth for the purpose of scienti\ufb01c research, communications and tourism. The device may be assembled from the surface upwards, avoiding dif\ufb01cult and expensive in-orbit construction. The space-elevator tower can provide access to lower altitude regions and can also be scaled to access altitudes above 15 km, or the typical ceiling altitude for commercial aviation. The approach may be further scaled to provide direct access to altitudes above 200 km and with the gravitation potential of Low Earth Orbit without the technical challenges associated with constructing a cable at least 35,000 km long. The elevator platforms also have signi\ufb01cant advantages over orbiting satellite platforms. Geographically \ufb01xed but providing access to regions of space closer to the surface than geostationary orbit, elevator platforms provide the ideal means to communicate over a wide area and to conduct remote sensing and tourism activities. As a tourist destination, the elevator platforms provide stations located at \ufb01xed attitudes from the surface for observation. The elevator platforms provide the means to access safely a region of space with a view extending hundreds of kilometers. \u2026Consider an example core-structure design for an Earth-based elevator to access near space at 20 km altitude. Advantageously, to access orbit, the elevator could be constructed at 5 km altitude in one of four regions on the equator. The core would be required to span a further 15 km altitude. Based on Elevator B, a suitable structure comprises of gas cells with constant wall thickness 1.2 cm arranged in a torus of inner diameter 228 m and outer diameter 230 m. Fabricated from Boron, a 15 km elevator structure can be supported by 150 bar hydrogen gas. Approximating the structure as two concentric cylinders, the mass of the structure is 6.5\u00d710^8kg, and the mass of the pressurization gas needed is 1.4\u00d710^8kg. Other core designs may be analyzed by comparison with the two-cylinder design and by appropriate adjustment for the amount of wall material utilized.Constructed at 5 km altitude, the structure would have a buoyant mass of 3.1\u00d710^6kg giving a total mass of 7.8\u00d710^8kg. The load capacity of the structure, in excess of that needed to support itself, is 3.1\u00d710^8kg of force equivalent. The critical buckling load at the top is 4.1\u00d710^9N, and at the center of gravity (located at 7.3 km up the core) the critical load is 1.6\u00d710^9N, which exceeds signi\ufb01cantly the dead weight load of the building, including the mass of the gas, indicating that the core would be structurally stable and able to support the raising of payloads of mass in excess of 10^6 kg. By further tapering the wall thickness, further design margin may be obtained by lowering the center of gravity and reducing the structural mass, or taller structures may be constructed. Alternatively, the core diameters can be tapered to increase the structural stiffness in the base, although the variation of core diameter may be undesirable for mounting elevator machinery. Additionally, the core can be segmented and pressurized equivalently without inducing an imbalance of support forces between segment walls. \u2026Consider a highly simpli\ufb01ed scenario where a single stage-to-orbit rocket is launched to a typical circular orbital height of 120 km. \u2026 Comparing initial to \ufb01nal rocket-mass ratios, the elevator launch at 20 km is shown to be 26% more ef\ufb01cient than the equivalent ground launch.Added 13June: If you search for \u201cSpace Tower\u201d you\u2019ll see Alexander Bolonkin has published over a half dozen times (eg 1 2 3) on inflatable space towers since 2002.  But the Acta Astronautica article doesn\u2019t cite him at all.  Suspicious.","13":" Don\u2019t Be \u201cRationalist\u201d  The first principle is that you must not fool yourself \u2014 and you are the easiest person to fool. Richard Feynman. This blog is called \u201cOvercoming Bias,\u201d and many of you readers consider yourselves \u201crationalists,\u201d i.e., folks who try harder than usual to overcome your biases. But even if you want to devote yourself to being more honest and accurate, and to avoiding bias, there\u2019s a good reason for you not to present yourself as a \u201crationalist\u201d in general. The reason is this: you must allocate a very limited budget of rationality.It seems obvious to me that almost no humans are able to force themselves to see honestly and without substantial bias on all topics. Even for the best of us, the biasing forces in and around us are often much stronger than our will to avoid bias. Because it takes effort to overcome these forces, we must choose our battles, i.e., we must choose where to focus our efforts to attend carefully to avoiding possible biases. I see four key issues:1. Priorities \u2013 You should spend your rationality budget where truth matters most to you. You can\u2019t have it all, so you must decide what matters most. For example, if you care mainly about helping others, and if they mainly rely on you via a particular topic, then you should focus your honesty on that topic. In particular, if you help the world mainly via your plumbing, then you should try to be honest about plumbing. Present yourself to the world as someone who is honest on plumbing, but not necessarily on other things. In this scenario we work together by being honest on different topics. We aren\u2019t \u201crationalists\u201d; instead, we are each at best \u201crationalist on X.\u201d2. Costs \u2013 All else equal, it is harder to be honest on more and wider topics, on topics where people tend to have emotional attachments, and on topics close to the key bias issues of the value and morality of you and your associates and rivals. You can reasonably expect to be honest about a wide range of topics that few people care much about, but only on a few narrow topics where many people care lots. The close you get to dangerous topics, the smaller your focus of honesty can be. You can\u2019t be both a generalist and a rationalist; specialize in something.3. Contamination \u2013 You should try to avoid dependencies between your beliefs on focus topics where you will try to protect your honesty, and the topics where you are prone to bias. Try not to have your opinions on focus topics depend on a belief that you or your associates are especially smart, perceptive, or moral. If you must think on risky topics about people, try to first study other people you don\u2019t care much about. If you must have an opinion on yourself, assume you are like most other people.4. Incentives \u2013 I\u2019m not a big fan of the \u201cstudy examples of bias and then will yourself to avoid them\u201d approach; it has a place, but gains there seem small compared to changing your environment to improve your incentives. Instead of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, step onto higher ground. For example, by creating and participating in a prediction market on a topic, you can induce yourself to become more honest on that topic. The more you can create personal direct costs of your dishonesty, the more honest you will become. And if you get paid to work on a certain topic, maybe you should give up on honesty about who if anyone should be paid to do that.So my advice is to choose a focus for your honesty, a narrow enough focus to have a decent chance at achieving honesty. Make your focus more narrow the more dangerous is your focus area. Try to insulate beliefs on your focus topics from beliefs on risky topics like your own value, and try to arrange things so you will be penalized for dishonesty. Don\u2019t persent yourself as a \u201crationalist\u201d who is more honest on all topics, but instead as at best \u201crationalist on X.\u201dSo, what is your X?","14":" Polarized USA  Diana Mutz\u2019s 2006 book Hearing the Other Side paints a bleak picture of American politics.  Among twelve nations compared, US folks most perceive that the two people (besides their spouse) they most talk to are politically partisan, and agree with them.  (These two factors are strongly correlated across nations.  Hong Kong and Japan are at the other extreme.)  In fact, only 34% of people in the US talk regularly to someone who they think disagrees with them politically, and \"only 23 percent of Americans could recall having a political conversation with someone who disagreed with them.\"This is a problem because talking to people you disagree with tells you about reasons for positions on the other side.  People know more reasons for positions they favor than for positions they don\u2019t favor.  Mutz shows that people who know more people who disagree with them know more reasons for positions on both sides, but people who know more people who agree with them know only more reasons for their side.So who are these rare people who sustain our political dialogue, via sincere discussions with others who disagree?  Mutz says they are:blacks more than whites,with the least education,with incomes under 40K,belonging to the fewest social associations,who vote and participate politically the least,with the least political knowledge or interest, andare political moderates more than strong partisans.And who are the others with whom they talk and disagree?  Mutz says they are more acquaintances than friends, who they meet less often.  These others are more often co-workers, neighbors, and people they meet in voluntary associations, and less often those they meet in places of worship.   So, real political debate is mostly done by poor uneducated moderate non-voters with little political knowledge and few social contacts, talking with people they hardly know and rarely talk to.  I suspect causation goes both ways here \u2013 not only are rich, educated, social, political folks more likely adopt the political opinions of their close associates (over distance others), but such folks also tend to avoid close association with those who disagree politically. This is of course bad news for US academics and professionals whose political views differ from their associates.  It seems I live in an unusually dark time and place politically.","15":" Women\u2019s Mathematical Abilities  Former Harvard President Larry Summers lost his job for suggesting that researchers consider the possibility that biology partially explains the dearth of female science professors. Some psychologists believe that if women are told they are less likely than men to be good at math then women will suffer from a \u201cstereotype threat\u201d that reduces their performance on math tests.Let\u2019s assume that this stereotype threat is real but also that there is some evidence that men are more likely than women to be born with the exceptionally strong mathematical ability needed to be a science professor.  (Full disclosure:  When I started college I wanted to be a theoretical physicist.  I quickly realized I wasn\u2019t good enough at math to accomplish this dream.)Many professors, especially at the women\u2019s college where I teach, discuss in class how society might and might not be discriminating against women.  Should these professors discuss possible biological reasons for why men and women don\u2019t achieve equal career outcomes?","16":" Lumpaland Parable  Once upon a time \u2026Before Willy Wonka came to Lumpaland, hundreds of fierce dragons preyed on ten thousand Oompa Loompas and other wildlife.  A thousand Oopmas tried in their free time to oppose dragons, and a hundred had full time jobs at the Dragon Institute. Instituters were impressive \u2013 they had charisma, spoke eloquently, made cool devices and mastered hard math.  Others wanted to read about, sleep with, and study under them.  At any one time only a few instituters were out near dragons, usually at a safe distance, focused on a few relatively-safe dragons.  Some complained instituters were too distracted playing institute politics and trying to seem impressive.  But when Oopmas had to choose between an instituter and an amateur, the instituter usually won.Amateurs were mostly content to read and argue.  And their readings and conversations rarely lingered long on one dragon.  While instituters focused on particular dragons, amateurs prided themselves on having passionate witty opinions on many dragons.  Amateurs were eager to associate with instituters, even as they complained instituters unfairly neglected their writings and favorite dragons.The few amateurs who focused on particular dragons were considered boring, and amateurs who actually fought dragons were considered dangerous, to be avoided.  If an amateur actually managed to dispatch a dragon, the Oompas nearby trusted to report on the incident were usually instituters, who would if possible take full credit.  (If the amateur\u2019s role could not be denied, he\u2019d be thanked for his lucky assistance to the institute\u2019s grand plan. To get more recognition, he\u2019d have to dispatch several dragons or join the institute.)Question: Biases afflict both amateur and instituter dragon judgments. Perhaps do-nothing amateurs are less biased, but so what?  Isn\u2019t it do-somethings\u2019 opinions that matter?Added 16May: This story was inspired seeing amateurs indignant that professionals do not engage their brief writings on difficult complex topics (e.g., many worlds, zombies, Fermi question, nano\/robot econ, disagreement, market manipulation).","17":" Scientists as Parrots  I just spent the last two days at a Whole Brain Emulation Workshop here at the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute.  Most of the dozen attendees were scientists who scan and model brains.  They were quite professional in their presentations and discussions, attending expertly to many subtle complications, but overall they were mostly excited and optimistic about the prospects for improving our abilities to scan, model, and emulate large brain areas, even entire brains, for many kinds of animals, including eventually humans.When asked if they would be interested in producing a consensus statement which made more precise their expectations about feasibility and rates of progress, however, these scientists expressed concern about their funding.  Their research is expensive, and they typically frame their work on larger scale brain emulation in other terms, which funding agencies prefer; these agencies would react poorly to hearing that these people did  research framed as \"whole brain emulation.\"I\u2019ve often seen such a pattern \u2013 scientists tell funding agencies, and all other public ears, just what they think the funding bodies want to hear.  I dearly wish we could have prediction markets on such topics, so we could find out whether the powers that be have good reasons for their negativity, reasons which would encourage them to bet, or whether they are expressing shallow unthinking prejudice, which betting markets might unmask.","18":" Sycophantry Masquerading As Bargains  The Catholic Church used to sell \u201cindulgences\u201d; you gave them cash and they gave you the assurance that God would let you sin without punishment. If you are at all suspicious about whether this church can actually deliver on their claim, this seems a bad deal. You give them something tangible and clearly valuable, and they give you a vague promise on something you can\u2019t see, and can\u2019t even check if anyone has ever received.We make similar bad \u201cbargains\u201d with a few kinds of workers, to whom we grant extraordinary privileges of \u201cself-regulation.\u201d That is, we let certain \u201cprofessionals\u201d run their own organizations which tell us how their job their job is to be done, and who can do it.

The philosopher Donald Sch\u00f6n says:In return for access to their extraordinary knowledge in matters of great human importance, society has granted them [professionals] a mandate for social control in their fields of specialization, a high degree of autonomy in their practice, and a license to determine who shall assume the mantle of professional authority.In their book The Future of the Professions: How Technology Will Transform the Work of Human Experts, Richard and Daniel Susskind elaborate:In acknowledgement of and in return for their expertise, experience, and judgement, which they are expected to apply in delivering affordable, accessible, up-to-date, reassuring, and reliable services, and on the understanding that they will curate and update their knowledge and methods, train their members, set and enforce standards for the quality of their work, and that they will only admit appropriately qualified individuals into their ranks, and that they will always act honestly, in good faith, putting the interests of clients ahead of their own, we (society) place our trust in the professions in granting them exclusivity over a wide range of socially significant services and activities, by paying them a fair wage, by conferring upon them independence, autonomy, rights of self-determination, and by according them respect and status.Notice how in this supposed bargain, what we give the professionals is concrete and clearly valuable, while what they give us (over what we\u2019d get without the deal) is vague and very hard for us to check. Like an indulgence. The Susskinds claim that while this bargain has been a good deal so far, we will soon cancel it:We predict that increasingly capable machines, operating on their own or with non-specialist users, will take on many of the tasks that have been the historic preserve of the professions. We anticipate an \u2018incremental transformation\u2019 in the way that we produce and distribute expertise in society. This will lead eventually to a dismantling of the traditional professions.This seems seriously mistaken to me. There is actually no bargain, there is just the rest of us submitting to professionals\u2019 prestige. Cheaper yet outcome-effective substitutes to expensive professionals have long been physically available, and yet we have mostly not chosen those substitutes due to our eagerness to affiliate with prestigious professionals. We don\u2019t choose nurses who can do primary care as well as doctors, and we don\u2019t watch videos of the best professors from which we could learn as much as from attending typical lectures in person. And we aren\u2019t interested in outcome track records for our lawyers. The existence of even more such future substitutes won\u2019t change this situation much.","19":" Know Your Propaganda  We are built to rationalize.  That is, our minds often unfairly defend our most deeply held beliefs; when we sense such beliefs being threatened, our minds distract us, refuse to comprehend alternatives, and grab onto weak excuses as if they were timber.  La-la-la-la-I-can\u2019t-hear-you.This makes it especially hard for those of us who want to overcome our biases to identify and question such beliefs.  But like many parasites, our unfairly held beliefs are most vulnerable when they are young, i.e., when we first acquire them, and when they must come up to a surface, rather than staying buried deep.For our deeply held beliefs that are passed down via genes, it can be very hard to even notice them, much less see when they are integrated into our other thoughts.  But beliefs that are passed down culturally are more vulnerable \u2013 there must be some visible social process whereby new generations learn these beliefs from older generations.Now beliefs that we learn implicitly, from gestures and expressions of others, can still be a lot of work to identify; you may have to watch a lot of behavior up close to notice the belief transmission.  Fortunately, many deeply held beliefs are transmitted out in the open, in explicit words, and even written down in books.Case in point: most of us attended public instead of private schools because our governments wanted to indoctrinate us into certain beliefs (and acts).  And to keep control, such schools make teachers stick to textbooks.  So one way to explicitly identify our possibly-unfair deeply held beliefs is to study the textbooks we learned from as kids.  If we could collect lists of important non-obvious beliefs we were taught as kids, and the supporting arguments we were given at the time, we could force ourselves to more directly confront the propaganda that formed us.Yes our minds might still unconsciously bias us in their favor, but we\u2019d have a much better chance to apply more neutral standards we\u2019ve learned over the years.  In this confrontation, we\u2019d know to rely less on unarticulated intuitions that might just reflect teachings from when our minds were weak and vulnerable.When propaganda is written down, saved, and organized, we have a better chance to confront and overcome it.  It is sad and suspicious that we are not in the habit of knowing and confronting our propaganda in this way.  Many say such confrontation is dangerous and harmful, that we gain important advantages from our self-deceptive acceptance of inaccurate propaganda.  But what evidence do we have that we are better off believing the lies we were told as kids?  That belief sure sounds like the sort of self-serving propaganda we expect to have been told.Surely as adults, at least some of us should face facts, know our propaganda, and ask how well supported it is.  Perhaps we will decide others are better off not knowing what we have learned.  But some should confront the beasts that lie within us.","20":" Big Signals  Between $6 and $9 trillion dollars\u2014about 8% of annual world-wide economic production\u2014is currently being spent on projects that individually cost more than $1 billion. These mega-projects (including everything from buildings to transportation systems to digital infrastructure) represent the biggest investment boom in human history, and a lot of that money will be wasted. \u2026Over the course of the last fifteen years, [Flyvbjerg] has looked at hundreds of mega-projects, and he found that projects costing more than $1 billion almost always face massive cost overruns. Nine out of ten projects faces a cost overrun, with costs 50% higher than expected in real terms not unusual. \u2026In fact, the number of mega-projects completed successfully\u2014on time, on budget, and with the promised benefits\u2014is actually too small for Flyvbjerg to determine why they succeeded with any statistical validity. He estimates that only one in a thousand mega-projects fit that criteria. (more; paper)You can probably throw most big firm mergers into this big inefficient project pot.There\u2019s a simple signaling explanation here. We like to do big things, as they make us seem big. We don\u2019t want to be obvious about this motive, so we pretend to have financial calculations to justify them. But we are purposely sloppy about those calculations, so that we can justify the big projects we want.It would be possible to make prediction markets that accurately told us on average that these financial calculations are systematically wrong. That could enable us to reject big projects that can\u2019t be justified by reasonable calculations. But the people initiating these projects don\u2019t want that, so it would have to be outsiders who set up these whistleblowing prediction markets. But alas as with most whistleblowers, the supply of these sort of whistleblowers is quite limited.","21":" Social Norms Are Far  We see social norms as more relevant when predicting the average behavior of a group, relative to predicting an individual\u2019s behavior:In judgments of morally relevant behaviors, forecasters estimated that a randomly selected individual (e.g., a student) would act more selflessly (e.g., give to charity) than would the population from which the individual was drawn (e.g., the student body). \u2026 When considering how an individual will behave, people give weight to an individual-level force on behavior: what an individual\u2019s moral conscience would lead one to do. When considering a population, forecasters give more emphasis to a group-level force on behavior: social norms and pressures. \u2026 Individuals were [also] forecast as more likely than populations to perform behaviors that emerge primarily because of an individual-level force\u2014a person\u2019s will\u2014but not behaviors that are encouraged by social norms.

In some cases, this is mostly unconscious, and most people are surprised to hear what is going on. In other cases most people kind of know it, even if they don\u2019t tend to talk about it. So if what I\u2019m about to tell you seems obvious, well just stop reading.I spent the last few days touring monuments near Washington D.C. A great many of them come with the explicit message \u201cRemember.\u201d As if to say \u201cBig things once happened, or nearly happened. If enough of us remember them, we can do better in the future to avoid bad things, and encourage good things.\u201d When your choice is data vs. ignorance, you know what you are supposed to choose.Except, if that were the goal we might do better to have big pretty places organized around categories of events, each with statistics on that type of event. The monument for wars might show stats on what kinds of wars went better. The monument for floods might show stats relating efforts to prevent floods to later consequences.But what we actually have are monuments for particular events, and particular people. In reality, these events and people are very complex. Depending on your assumptions and perspectives, you can draw a great many contradictory lessons from them. And usually experts do in fact hold a wide range of conflicting views. Especially if we include experts from other nations, etc.But monuments usually show little of this wide range of interpretations. Instead, the basic context usually gives visitors a pretty good idea of preferred interpretations. So the monument itself doesn\u2019t have to belabor the point \u2013 just a few choice quotes and items selected for presentation in particular contexts are enough. Treating the monument respectfully can then function as a way to signal one\u2019s respect for these usual interpretations.If monuments gave explicit ideological sermons, visitors who disagreed might try to refute the arguments given. Out loud, on the spot. And many others would have a plausible reason to not want to go there. But if there are only a bunch of artifacts in a beautiful setting, a reminder that people died, and an exhortation to \u201cremember\u201d, what can anyone rebut, and what excuse is there not to go? Even though going there will be on average interpreted as support for the usual interpretation.For example, Arlington National Cemetery prominently displays the mast of The Maine, a ship sunk in 1898 in Havana harbor. The Spanish were blamed, \u201cRemember the Maine\u201d became a battle cry, and the U.S. had an excuse to start the Spanish-American war. Though today it seems more likely that the explosion was accidental.A world intent on not forgetting and learning from key data might have a monument to events that start wars, and present stats on the fraction of wars that were started on fake pretexts. And perhaps summarize key arguments on the causes of wars and ways to prevent wars. But in our world there are mainly monuments that, in a pretty, solemn, and patriotic context, remind visitors that people died, and that others uttered the phrase \u201cRemember the Maine.\u201d Damn Spaniards ..","23":" Why Borg At Work, Not Home?  We have a love-hate relation with the division of labor.  On the one hand, we treasure our individuality and autonomy; we often do things differently just to show that we can.  On the other hand, we know that the division of labor, with its regimentation and standardization, is what lets us be amazingly rich.  But I wonder: why do we accept borg-like regimentation more at work than at home?We produce both at home and on at work.  At home we make meals, clean clothes, entertainment events, etc., while at work we make many other things, like pots, t-shirts, TVs, etc that are useful inputs into home production.  Yet while scale economies are possible with both kinds of production, we are more reluctant to use scale economies in home production.Most workplaces lower costs by regimenting and standardizing routines.  Employees show up at standard times, wear standard uniforms, write formula memos by scheduled deadlines, and so on.  Communities with limited budgets, like orphanages, military barracks, or school dorms, know that cheap ways to manage home life also involve a lot of centralization and standardization.   For example, one can feed lots of folks cheaper if they will eat the same food at the same time, and clothe lots of folks cheaper if they will wear the same kind of clothing centrally cleaned.Yes, the more we differ the less enamored we are of communal efficiencies, and the richer we are the more we can indulge such differences.  We are willing to live in smaller homes, with food and clothing of lower quality ingredients, in order to eat our own different food wearing our own different clothes in our own different home.But the same logic should apply at work as well.  In trade for lower wages, employers should allow us more variation in work habits, forms, dress, hours, etc.  And while we probably do see more of this with increasing wealth, it seems clear that we accept more regimentation in work production, relative to home production.  Why?If you\u2019ve been reading this blog for a while you won\u2019t be surprised to see me consider a signaling explanation.    Here goes.Movies and TV sitcoms focus overwhelmingly on non-work life.   I suspect we see our work life as being less visible than non-work social life to the people we most care about impressing; the money we make from our work life, and the overall status of our job, seems more visible.   Also, at home and at leisure, the uniqueness of our behavior seems no less visible than the quality of its ingredients.So to a first approximation, what others mainly see about us is the status of our job type, the income we have to spend, and the distinctive ways we spend our money and non-work social time; they don\u2019t see as much of our distinctive job habits.  Thus we focus on signaling our autonomy, identity, taste, style etc. via non-work individuality, and at work focus more on money and job type status.   We are willing to be borgs at work so that we can afford to be all the more distinctive divas at home.Added: Rather than admit we borg at work to better signal, we\u2019d rather blame it on evil \u201cpower hungry\u201d work organizations and leaders.  This may be a big part of why folks see for-profit work firms as evil, relative to non-profit leisure organizations like clubs, churches, families, etc.  My wife works for a non-profit whose mission she celebrates, while still loathing the executives who run it.","24":" How To Vs. What To  When should you seek decision advice?  One factor is decision size: the bigger the decision, the more effort you should devote, including effort to get advice.  Oddly, on our biggest decisions, other people seem to go out of their way to offer us advice that we don\u2019t want to hear or follow.  We rarely seek out advice, and when we do it is usually on much smaller decisions. For example, we like HowTo books, but not WhatTo books.  How to manage your computer, not what machine to manage.  How to please your partner, not what partner to please.  How to fix your house, not where to live.  How to drive fast, not what speed to drive.  How to get promoted, not what job to work at.  How to raise your kids, not how many kids to raise.  And so on.One reason we avoid getting advice is that it lowers our status relative to those who give advice.  Of course this is also makes asking for advice a good way to flatter and supplicate.  Not sure if this explains the puzzle though.  But all this doesn\u2019t seem to bode well for fielding decision markets on the biggest organizational decisions.","25":" Cycles of War & Empire  I\u2019ve just read five of Peter Turchin\u2019s books: Historical Dynamics (2003), War & Peace & War (2006), Secular Cycles (2009), Ultra Society (2015), and Ages of Discord (2016). Four of them in the last week. I did this because I love careful big picture thinking, and Turchin is one of the few who does this now on the big question of historical cycles of conflict and empire. While historians today tend to dislike this sort of analysis, Turchin defies them, in part because he\u2019s officially a biologist. I bow to honor his just defiance and careful efforts.Turchin\u2019s main story is a modest variation on related farmer-era historical cycle stories, such as by Jack Goldstone in 1991, & Ibn Khaldun in 1377 (!):Different groups have different degrees of cooperation .. cohesiveness and solidarity. .. Groups with high [cohesion] arise on .. frontier .. area where an imperial boundary coincides with a fault line between two [ethnic] communities .. places where between group competition is very intense. .. Only groups possessing high levels of [cohesion] can construct large empires. ..Stability and internal peace bring prosperity, and prosperity causes population increase .. leads to overpopulation, .. causes lower wages, higher land rents, and falling per capital incomes. At first, low wages and high rents bring unparalleled wealth to the upper class, but as their numbers and appetites grow, they also begin to suffer from falling incomes. Declining standards of life breed discontent and strife. The elites turn to the state for employment and additional income and drive up its expenditures at the same time that the tax revenue declines. .. When the state\u2019s finances collapse, it loses the control of the army and police. Freed from all restraints, strife among the elites escalates into civili war, while the discontent among the poor explodes into popular rebellions.The collapse of order brings .. famine, war, pestilence, and death. .. Population declines and wages increase, while rents decline. .. Fortunes of the upper classes hit bottom. .. Civil wars thin the ranks of the elites. .. Intra-elite competition subsides, allowing the restoration of order. Stability and internal peace bring prosperity, and another cycle begins. (pp.5-8 W&P&W)Turchin (& coauthor Nefedov) collect much data to show that this is a robust farmer-era pattern, even if there are many deviations. For example, in Europe, 33 of 43 frontier situations gave rise to big empires, yet only 4 of 57 of non-frontier situations did (p.84 HD). \u201cSecular cycles\u201d vary in duration from one to four centuries; Western Europe saw 8 cycles in 22 centuries, while China saw 8 cycles in 21 centuries (p.306,311 SC). During the low instability part of each cycle, instability shows a rough \u201calternating generations\u201d 50 year cycle of conflict.I\u2019ll grant that Turchin seems to have documented a reasonably broad pattern, containing most of his claimed elements. Yes, empires tend to start from frontier groups with high cohesion, and core cohesion changes slowly. First there\u2019s war success and a growing area and population, and bigger cities. Eventually can come crowding and falling wages. Inequality also grows, with more richer elites, and this is quite robust, continuing even after wages fall.While the amount of external war doesn\u2019t change over the cycle, success in war falls. Many signs of social cohesion decline, and eventually there\u2019s more elite infighting, with crime, duels, misspending state revenue, mistreatment of subordinates, and eventually civil war. Big wars can cut population, and also elite numbers and wealth. Eventually war abates and cohesion rises, though not to as high as when the empire started. A new cycle may begin; empires go through 1-3 cycles before being displaced by another empire.Just as science fiction is often (usually?) an allegory about issues today, I suspect that historians who blame a particular fault for the fall of the Roman Empire tend to pick faults that they also want to warn against in their own era. Similarly, my main complain about Turchin is that he attributes falling cohesion mainly to increased inequality \u2013 an \u201coverproduction\u201d of elites who face \u201cincreased competition\u201d. Yes, inequality is much talked about among elites today, but the (less-forager-like) ancients were less focused on it.As Scheidel said in The Great Leveler, inequality doesn\u2019t seem to cause civil wars, and civil wars tend to increase inequality during and after the war (p.203). External wars reduce inequality for losers and increase it for winners, without changing it much overall. It is only big mass mobilization wars of the 1900s that seem to clearly cause big falls in inequality.In biology, over multiple generations organisms slowly accumulate genetic mutations, which reduce their fitness. But this degradation is countered by the fact that nature and mates select for better organisms, which have fewer mutations. Similarly, it seems to me that the most straightforward account of the secular cycle is to say since empire founders are selected out of a strong competition for very high cohesion, we should expect cohesion to \u201cregress to the mean\u201d as an empire evolves.That is, in order to predict most of the observed elite misdeeds later in the secular cycle, all we need to assume is a random walk in cohesion that tends to fall back to typical levels. Yes, we might want to include other effects in our model. For example, civil war may allow a bit more selection for subgroups with more cohesion, and humans may have a psychological inclination to cohere more during and after a big war. But mostly we should just expect cohesion to decline from its initial extreme value, and that\u2019s all a simple model needs.Yes, Turchin claims that we know more about what causes cohesion declines. But while he goes to great effort to show that the data fit his story on which events happen in what order during cycles, I didn\u2019t see him offering evidence to support his claim that inequality causes less cohesion. He just repeatedly gives examples where inequality happened, and then instability happened, as if that proves that the one caused the other.We already have good reasons to expect new empires to start with a small area, population, and inequality. And this by itself is enough to predict growing population, which eventually crowds to cut wages, and increasing inequality, which should happen consistently in a very wide range of situations. I don\u2019t see a need for, or data support for, the additional hypothesis that inequality cuts cohesion. We may of course discover more things that influence cohesion, and if so we can add them to our basic secular cycle model. But we don\u2019t need such additions to predict most of the cycle features that Turchin describes.In his latest book, Turchin points out many U.S. signs today of rising inequality and declining social cohesion, and at the end asks \u201cWill we be capable of taking collective action to avoid the worst of the impending democratic -structural crisis? I hope so.\u201d But I worry that his focus on inequality leads people to think they need to fight harder to cut inequality. In contrast, what we mostly need is just to fight less. The main way that inequality threatens to destroy us is that we are tempted to fight over it. Instead, let us try more to see ourselves as an \u201cus\u201d contrasted with a \u201cthem\u201d, an us that needs to stick together, in part via chilling and compromising, especially regarding divisive topics like inequality.","26":" Dalio\u2019s Principles  When I write and talk about hidden motives, many respond by asking how they could be more honest about their motives. I usually emphasize that we have limited budgets for honesty, and that it is much harder to be honest about yourself than others. And it is especially hard to be honest about the life areas that are the most sacred to you. But some people insist on trying to be very honest, and our book can make them unhappy when they see just how far they have to go.It is probably easier to be honest if you have community support for honesty. And that makes it interesting to study the few groups who have gone the furthest in trying to create such community support. An interesting example is the hedge fund Bridgewater, as described in Dalio\u2019s book Principles:An idea meritocracy where people can speak up and say what they really think. (more)#1 New York Times Bestseller \u2026 Ray Dalio, one of the world\u2019s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he\u2019s developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business\u2014and which any person or organization can adopt to help achieve their goals. \u2026 Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States. \u2026 Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater\u2019s exceptionally effective culture. \u2026 It is these principles \u2026 that he believes are the reason behind his success. \u2026 are built around his cornerstones of \u201cradical truth\u201d and \u201cradical transparency,\u201d \u2026 \u201cbaseball cards\u201d for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. (more)This book seems useful if you were the absolute undisputed ruler of a firm, so that you could push a culture of your choice and fire anyone who seems to resist. And were successful enough to have crowds eager to join, even after you\u2019d fired many. And didn\u2019t need to coordinate strongly with customers, suppliers, investors, and complementors. Which I guess applies to Dalio.But he has little advice to offer those who don\u2019t sit in an organization or social network that consistently rewards \u201cradical truth.\u201d He offers no help in thinking about how to trade honesty against the others things your social contexts will demand of you. Dalio repeatedly encourages honesty, but he admits that it is often painful, and that many aren\u2019t suited for it. He mainly just says to push through the pain, and get rid of people who resist it, and says that these big visible up-front costs will all be worth it in the long run.Dalio also seems to equate conflict and negative opinions with honesty. That is, he seeks a culture where people can say things that others would rather not hear, but doesn\u2019t seem to consider that such negative opinions need not be \u201chonest\u201d opinions. The book makes hundreds of claims, but doesn\u2019t cite outside sources, nor compare itself to other writings on the subject. Dalio doesn\u2019t point to particular evidence in support of particular claims, nor give them any differing degrees of confidence, nor credit particular people as the source of particular claims. It is all just stuff he\u2019s all sure of, that he endorses, all supported by the evidence of his firm\u2019s success.I can believe that the firm Bridgewater is full of open conflict, with negative opinions being frequently and directly expressed. And it would be interesting to study social behavior in such a context. I accept that this firm functions doing things this way. But I can\u2019t tell if it succeeds because of or in spite of this open conflict. Yes this firm succeeds, but then so do many others with very different cultures. The fact that the top guy seems pretty self-absorbed and not very aware of the questions others are likely to ask of his book is not a good sign.But if its a bad sign its not much of one; plenty of self-absorbed people have built many wonderful things. What he has helped to build might in fact be wonderful. Its just too bad that we can\u2019t tell much about that from his book.25May2019: Someone who wishes to remain anonymous just wrote to me saying:I just happen to read your article from last year on Dalios Principles. I was struck by the quality of your observations. In Bridgewater terms I am \u2018believable\u2019 in assessing this as I was there for a number of years. Your inferences are especially insightful given you did not work there. Well done on your article.","27":" Strictness Aids Hypocrisy  Long ago in traffic school the teacher asked us all how fast we\u2019d gone over the speed limit.  The lowest answer was five miles an hour \u2013 it was a black resident of East Palo Alto who had been driving in Palo Alto. Many of us nodded knowingly. Palo Alto is a rich community with unusually low speed limits, and East Palo Alto was its poorer neighbor.  Many of us suspected that the Palo Alto police were especially vigilent against speeding violations by black visitors from East Palo Alto, and that especially low speed limits helped them to discourage East Palo Alto folks from visiting Palo Alto.This illustrates a general principle: stricter rules typically enable more unequal rule enforcement. With excessively strict rules, more folks are willing to let rule enforcement slide sometimes, which creates a bigger difference in outcomes between folks who are liked vs. disliked by rule enforcers. Social groups with stricter rules need not discouarge ruled behaviors more; they may instead encourage more attention to connections and alliances to protect against rule enforcement. As in:\u201cSure George technically violated the rules here, and yes he should suffer.  But George has already suffered so much, and strict enforcement of this rule would end his promising career and shame his whole family.  He\u2019s learned his lesson, and could contribute so much more by staying in his position. Can\u2019t we find it in our hearts to follow the spirit of the law, rather than the letter?\u201dMy homo hypocritus hypothesis is that humans developed huge brains to manage the process of subtly evading social norms while pretending to fully support them. Since those who think themselves better at this process should favor stricter rules, people should prefer to seem to favor strict rules in order to show confidence in their abilities.  In this way the urge toward excessively strict rules may gain quite widespread support.","28":" Ignoring Betrayal  Suspicious:  I suspect my long-time business partner of corrupting our venture's bylaws to give him lopsided gains from our joint efforts.  Confronting him might devastate our relation, but I have to know.  What should I do?Business-Abby:  Give careful thought, please, to what you \"have to\" know.  Most who fear cheating are mistaken, and even if your bylaws are lopsided that could just be an honest mistake.  Even mentioning your suspicions to anyone might destroy your business, and could you really live with yourself if you destroyed your life's work, and betrayed employees, customers, and suppliers who rely on you?  If you wouldn't act on the info, why get it?  If you must do something, first consult with a lawyer about the consequences of even looking into this possibility. This would be odd business advice; I'd suggest first privately asking an accountant if your bylaws are lopsided.  Why get worked up over something you can cheaply check on?  But the above is pretty much what advice-columnist Carolyn Hax tells a man who suspects his wife's two year old daughter is not his:Give careful thought, please, to what you \"have to\" know. When just seeking the truth could change your life in dramatic and irreversible ways, it's best to start not by actually doing something but by inviting each possible truth into your imagination as fact. \u2026 You need to \u2026 assume your wife did cheat \u2026 and then you need to decide whether you'd want to stay in the marriage or leave.If the answer is to stay \u2026 then you need to ask yourself, is that outcome better served by not digging into the past? If the answer is to leave, are you ready to challenge your paternity \u2014 or have it challenged by your at-that-point-estranged wife? \u2026  You can't entirely rule out the rarer than rare, yet not unprecedented, hospital error. \u2026If you decide you'd want this child no matter what, then the question becomes, again, why you'd want to risk everything to scratch even a torturous itch.  And finally: What if you started digging, wrecked your marriage and learned your daughter is \"yours\"? \u2026 If you're considering any action at all, have a lawyer vet it legally. Only then can you be confident whether truth-seeking serves your interests \u2014 and your family's \u2014 or smashes them to bits.Is there any other common betrayal situation where neutral third parties would so strongly advise not looking to see if you've been betrayed?  I can't think of one.","29":" The Complexity Critique  Razib at Gene Expression:I have always been struck by starkness of human hypocrisy and its incongruity in the face of avowed beliefs. \u2026 Sin is common, and human weakness in the face of contradiction the norm.  Mens\u2019 hearts are easily divided, and simultaneously sincere in their inclinations. \u2026 All this leads to the point that I believe far too many of those of us who wish to comprehend human nature scientifically lack a basic grasp of it intuitively. \u2026 Many atheists simply lack a deep understanding of what drives people to be religious, and that our psychological model of those who believe in gods is extremely suspect. The \"irrationality\" and \"contradiction\" of human behavior may be rendered far more systematically coherent simply by adding more parameters into the model. \u2026 When I engage with these sorts of issues with readers of Overcoming Bias or Singularitarians my suspicions become even stronger because I see in some individuals an even greater lack of fluency in normal cognition than my own. \u2026 My point is that understanding human nature is not a matter of fitting humanity to our expectations and wishes, but modeling it as it is, whether one thinks that that nature is irrational or not within one\u2019s normative framework.This frustrating critique is frustrating common: \"You\u2019re wrong because your model is too simple.  But I\u2019m not going to tell you what your model is missing, at least not in a clear enough way to help you improve your model.\"  Yes of course almost all our models are too simple.  We all know that; what we don\u2019t know is exactly what complexities we should be adding to our models.  And for the record I was a teen cultist and my dad and brother were\/are church pastors.For social scientists I think there is actually an advantage in having a less powerful intuitive understanding of human behavior \u2013 it helps us notice things that need explaining.  To want to explain particular human behaviors you first need to see them as puzzling, and people with powerful intuitive understandings can predict behavior so well intuitively that they often don\u2019t notice behaviors that are at odds with our best theories.","30":" Parsing The Parable  The timing of Eliezer\u2019s post on outside views, directly following mine on an outside view of singularity, suggests his is a reply to mine.  But instead of plain-speaking, Eliezer offers a long Jesus-like parable, wherein Plato insists that outside views always trump inside views, that it is obvious death is just like sleep, therefore that \"our souls exist in the house of Hades.\" I did not suggest mine was the only or best outside view, or that it trumps any inside view of singularity. Reasonable people should agree inside and outside views are both valuable, and typically of roughly comparable value.  So if Eliezer thought my outside analysis was new and ably done, with a value typical of outside analyses, he might say \"good work old boy, you\u2019ve made a substantial contribution to my field of Singularity studies.\" Instead we must interpret his parable.  Some possibilities:His use of Plato\u2019s analogy suggests he thinks my comparison of a future AI revolution to the four previous suddenly growth rate jumps is no better motivated than Plato\u2019s (to Eliezer poorly motivated) analogy.His offering no other outside view to prefer suggests he thinks nothing that has ever happened is similar enough a future AI revolution to make an outside view at all useful.His contrasting aerospace engineers\u2019 success to schedulers\u2019 failures in inside views, suggests he thinks he has access to inside views of future AIs whose power is more like aerospace engineering than project scheduling. Look, in general to do a multivariate statistical analysis of a set of related cases one must judge what cases to include, with what variables to describe them, and what kind of a model of multivariate relations to apply.  So yes when there is more uncertainty there can be more disagreements about the best approach, and the outside view becomes less useful.But more uncertainty also makes inside views less useful.  When many parameter value combos are possible one must choose a distribution with which to sample over them.  And tractable analyzes must focus on a few factors considered the most important.  More uncertainty makes for more disagreements here as well.  So I don\u2019t yet see a general rule saying inside views tend to be more valuable when there is more uncertainty.  Future AI is so important and hard to study I\u2019d think interested folks would grab at any concrete guides they could find, including careful outside views.  I look forward to hearing clear reviewable results from an inside analysis, particularly on the crucial question I addressed of transition-induced inequality.  So far all I\u2019ve seen is folks noting that we don\u2019t know enough to exclude the possibility of huge inequality, which by itself seems a pretty weak argument.","31":" Superhumans Live Among Us  Computers are impressive machines, and they get more impressive every year, as hardware gets cheaper and software gets better. But while they are substantially better than humans on many important tasks, still overall humans earn far more income from using their smarts than do computers. And at past rates of progress it looks like it will take centuries before computers earn more income overall.The usual explanation for why humans are so much more capable is their flexibility, which probably results mainly from their breadth. A computer doing a task usually has available to it a far smaller range of methods, knowledge, and data. When what it has are good enough, a computer can be far more accurate and cheaper than a human. But when when a computer lacks important relevant method, knowledge, and data, then you just can\u2019t do without that human flexibility and breadth. You might hire a human to work with a computer, but still you need that human on the team.In our world today, most people are specialists; they spend years learning the methods, knowledge, and data relevant to an existing recognized specialty area. And when your problem falls well within such an existing area, that is exactly the sort of person you want to work on it.But often we face problems that don\u2019t fall well within existing specialty areas. If we can give a short list of specialty areas that cover our problem, then we can collect a team with members in all those areas. Because talking between people is much less efficient that communication within one person, this team will take a lot longer to solve our problem. But still, eventually such teams are usually up to the task.However, sometimes we face problems where we don\u2019t know which kinds of expertise are relevant. In such cases what we really need is a person who is expert in far more areas than are most people. Let me call such people \u201cpolymaths\u201d, though that word is often used for people who have wide interests but not wide expertise. A polymath with expertise in enough areas has a far better chance of solving broad hard-to-classify problems. A polymath is to an ordinary human as that human is to a computer. At least in terms of relative flexibility and breadth, and thus generality.Quite often a specialist will see that some of their tools apply to a problem, and not realize that there are tools from other areas that also apply. And if specialists from other areas tell them that other tools do apply, they will usually not have sufficient expertise to directly evaluate that claim. And so the usual human arrogance will often lead them to disagree. Specialists from each area will say that they can help, and discount the possibility of help from other kinds of specialists.Now a clear long track record showing that teams that include several kinds of specialists tend to solve a certain kind of problem better may convince many specialists that other specialists are relevant. But we often lack such clear long track records. In such cases, we often get stuck in a pattern of having a particular kind of expert deal with a particular kind of problem, even when other kinds of experts could help.The same thing applies when humans know more than computers. Usually there\u2019s nothing the human could say to prove to the computer that it is missing important relevant tools and knowledge. The computer just doesn\u2019t understand these other tools well enough. So the computer has to just be told to defer to the human when the human thinks it knows better.Bottom line: superhuman really live among us, whose better abilities compared to us really are analogous to the way we are so much better than computers: they have more flexibility, due to more breadth of expertise. But without clear track records, they usually don\u2019t have ways to convince us to listen to them. Once we\u2019ve found one kind of expert relevant to a problem, those experts tend to tell us that other kinds aren\u2019t needed, and we tend to believe them.Superhumans walk among us, but don\u2019t get the respect they deserve. We reserve our highest honors for those who are best at specific recognized specialty areas, and mainly only recognize polymaths when they are good enough at one such area.Added 22Apr: Actually, someone with multiple expertise areas isn\u2019t what I meant if they haven\u2019t worked to integrate them. Compared to computers, the human mind can not only do many things, it has integrated those tools together well. When areas overall, one needs a common representation to accommodate them both. Is one a special case of the other? Do they focus on different parameters in a common parameter space? I mean to refer to a polymath who has successfully integrated their many areas of expertise.","32":" Seeking Status Fashion Stats  Some societies are more healthy, productive, innovative, and stronger than others. We now understand many factors that contribute to this difference, and we collect and track many stats related to these factors. To predict future changes in social health, it is especially important to track well the stats that change the fastest. After all, for slowly changing factors infrequent noisy measures may do fine.However, I see one factor which is important, which can and does change rapidly, and yet where we do very little tracking of related stats. That factor is: fashions in the status markers seen as determining who is more elite. Let me explain.All cultures and subcultures distinguish people by their status, via agreed-upon markers, such as wealth, power, attractiveness, credentials, wit, and much more. While the weights that different cultures put on these things usually have the same signs, their magnitudes can differ greatly. I\u2019ve seen such weights vary greatly over my lifetime, and across the many social worlds I\u2019ve inhabited. For example, societies that put more weight on military valor are likely to fight more wars, those that put more weight on business profits will see more wealth, and those that care more about music will hear more music.These differences have huge consequences, as a big fraction of social energy is devoted to seeking higher status. Especially among the \u201cbest\u201d people. These difference probably vary not only by nation, but by city and region, by industry and profession, and by ethnic and other subcultures. And over time, status marker fashion changes not only with overall fashions, but also with the status of subareas, such as recently when tech got rich and was then taken over by traditional elites.Changes in status fashion have the potential to bring great societies crashing down, and to raise up once low societies. Such fashions do in fact often seem to change a lot over time timescale of decades. And yet I know of no attempts to create data series to measure these crucial changes. Seems a hole worth filling.We should also put a lot more thought into how to change our status markers to be promote social health. And to prevent the rise of unhealthy markers.","33":" Biased Revenge?  Yesterday Bryan Caplan asked:What\u2019s wrong with revenge?  To be more specific: Suppose X is the most severe morally acceptable punishment for act Y committed by person Z. Suppose that the government fails to do anything about Y. What\u2019s wrong if a person personally affected by act Y does X to Z?In the comments, Matt C looks to bias: [Compared to public revenge,] personal revenge is too likely to get the wrong guy, and personal revenge is too likely to be excessive.Acad Ronin looks to feuds:\"[The rule of law is] the transfer of the duty of revenge to the Queen.

At which point I considered midgrade gas, and noticed: one is better off mixing regular and premium than buying midgrade!  For regular, midgrade, premium, the $\/gal. prices were 1.77, 1.92, 2.02 , while the octane ratings were 87, 89, 93.  So the first jump gives you 2 octane points for $0.15, while the second jump gives you 4 octane points for only $0.10.  Since mixing gas averages the octane ratings, if you mix 2\/3 regular with 1\/3 premium, you make your own midgrade gas for only 1.85, saving 0.07.  I then went searching and found this Feb \u201908 paper:Regular octane remains the product of choice for most consumers with an 82.2% market share in 2006.  Midgrade is a mature product with a 2006 market share of 9.3%. Premium\u2019s market share ranks last at 8.4% in 2006. \u2026 Midgrade is a redundant product offering, easily and almost costlessly replicated by mixing existing regular and premium products. Indeed, this redundancy is widely known and exploited by \u2026 just-in-time mixing at the retail pump from separate underground regular and premium storage tanks. \u2026 It is rare to see a consumer create a midgrade by buying from two retail feedstocks at a single retail gas station. This is true despite the overwhelming evidence that consumer midgrade mixing is almost uniformly the least costly way to buy retail midgrade. \u2026Consider a midgrade buyer making a 17-gallon purchase.  With a 3.13 cents per gallon spread between the posted midgrade price and the cost of an equivalent mixture of premium and regular, the 17-gallon consumer saves 53.21 cents per fill-up. Assuming that scanning the same credit card a second time and changing hoses takes an additional 30 seconds, the savings would accrue at $63.85 per hour of mixing time. As this is an after tax savings, the before tax implied wage for a mixing buyer in a 40% combined marginal tax bracket would be $106.42 per hour risk free. While this savings reflects the nationwide average, it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate how lucrative mixing can be. A recent observation in the Los Angeles metropolitan area indicated a 20-cent spread from regular to midgrade and a 10-cent spread from midgrade to premium. The effective before-tax wage rate for a 17-gallon buyer\u2019s mixing at this station is $340 per hour risk free.Even with lower gas prices you\u2019ll still make a handsome wage.  You can even avoid the extra changing costs if you alternate between filling half-empty tanks with regular and premium; you\u2019ll alternate between midgrade and a gas halfway between midgrade and premium, and you\u2019ll pay less than the midgrade price.  The amazing thing here is how eagerly people monitor gas station prices to save a few cents, and yet completely ignore grade rate savings.","36":" Regulating Government  Wall Street is apparently profiting from helping local governments use an accounting trick to underfund pensions:Pension bonds \u2026 current boom is \u2026 being driven \u2026 by a new accounting quirk that has largely escaped public notice while morphing into a major marketing tool for Wall Street banks. The quirk stems from a rule change that was meant to force governments to more clearly disclose the health of their pension funds. \u2026 If a pension plan is so poorly funded that it is projected to run out of cash, the new rules require it to make less optimistic projections about future returns. That increases the reported pension shortfall. But if governments infuse a big slug of borrowed money into the fund, they can resume using optimistic projections, and the shortfall shrinks. \u2026A review by ProPublica and The Post of the 20 largest pension bonds issued since 1996 found that in three-fourths of the deals, governments did not make their full required contribution in the years after the bonds were sold. \u2026 Because of the underfunding, most of the pension funds now are worse off than before the bonds were issued. (more)I find it plausible that these pension bonds are often bad ideas, and that some general regulation might be useful to prevent their misapplication. But today I\u2019m less interested in the particular issue of pensions, and more in the general issue of when democratic governments can be trusted to act in the interest of their voters.Consider also the examples of public employee unions, and of eminent domain. In all these cases we don\u2019t trust democratic governments to make the best choices for their citizens, and so we may empower some other democratic government to regulate or constrain those distrusted governments. For example, it seems we don\u2019t trust governments to choose good wages for their employees, since we empower unions to negotiate with them.It is not just that some citizens aren\u2019t allowed to vote, or that governments representing different regions may have conflicts, or that the same government at different times can have conflicting time-inconsistent preferences. It seems to also be about a limited ability of citizens to pay attention to government activities. But how is it exactly that citizens can pay enough attention to the regulating government to help it choose a good regulation role, but can\u2019t pay enough attention to the regulated government, tempting that government to make bad decisions? How is this supposed to work, even in theory?This seems an important issue, and I\u2019m interested in reading more about it. I expect there is a literature out there on this, but I don\u2019t recall ever coming across it. Anyone have some good cites?This topic is of course related to the possibility that governments may often be over-regulated.","37":" Variolation Test Design  Okay, what the variolation concept needs most now is a trial\/test\/experiment ASAP. So to help get the ball rolling, let me sketch a tentative plan. I\u2019m NOT saying this plan is now good enough. I\u2019m saying let\u2019s talk together about how to make it better. (Not so interested here in those ever popular \u201cthis can never work\u201d comments.)As with most projects, the obvious first top issue is staffing, especially leaders. This needs leaders who not only have the ability and expertise to execute it, but who can also inspire confidence in its other staff, subjects, patrons, sponsors, and audiences. (The most I\u2019ve ever led is an assistant, so alas I don\u2019t seem a good candidate.) The main point here is to inspire audiences to action, and that won\u2019t happen if audiences don\u2019t believe the project\u2019s purported results, nor if they find its people too odious to associate with.So the main purpose of this post is to try to attract participants, especially leaders, to pick up this ball and run with it. I\u2019ll run with you, but I can\u2019t run it by myself. When someone makes a good suggestion, such as in the comments, I\u2019m likely to edit this post to include it. You are warned.Innovation \u2013 Time is short here. And it will no doubt be hard to attack funds, staff, subjects, and needed permissions. So we seek the smallest simplest fastest least-risky test plan that could plausibly inspire further action, including bigger follow-on trials. This is not the time to invent whole new procedures; this is a time to copy and minimally-modify successful existing procedures.Dimensions \u2013 Unless we have a pretty good idea of the ideal procedure, we can\u2019t just directly test that against a control group. Also, it seems hard to set up a control group to be infected fast \u201cnaturally\u201d. But in a small experiment we can\u2019t explore very many dimensions either. An obvious compromise is to just look at variation on a single axis, or at most two. Make a plausible standard choice on all the other dimensions, and then see how outcomes depend on that one variable (or two). And an obvious candidate for that one variable is dose, though delivery method seems a strong contender. (Virus strain would be third candidate dimension if we had evidence suggesting strain mortality differences.) One hundred subjects could be okay for this, and we might even make do with twenty if necessary.Subjects \u2013 The more homogenous the subject pool, the better chance to see dose and other effects clearly, but the less well the results generalize to larger populations. We\u2019d prefer to focus on subjects who have the least chance of getting hurt by infection. But to let us compare our results to others, we need our subject selection criteria to correspond to variables often used to estimate hazards in other populations. Selecting by age and comorbidity may be sufficient. Selecting the young and healthy also puts a priority on finding outcome measures that can distinguish well between low levels of symptom severity.Outcomes \u2013 In a small trial, we just can\u2019t use death as the outcome measure; not enough will die. So we need good ways to measure final symptom severity.  Viral load sounds good, but how expensive is that? Count coughs? Breathing strength (vs. previous)? Chest x-ray? CT scan? Ultrasound? Temperature? Functional assessment?Recovery \u2013 We also have to decide how long to wait in the disease progress of each subject until we report preliminary results. When are they recovered? Of course we should continue to monitor subjects after this point to see if further developments change our initial results. A week after symptoms end? A low virus load? Fail a covid test?Dosing \u2013 If dosing is the main variable, then we need a very standard way to dose subjects. An obvious candidate is to use water dilution. For example, take N face masks from a sick (high risk but low symptoms) covid19 patient, swirl them in a big tub of (clean!) water, add whatever non-toxic materials viruses like, mix it all well, and then freeze it. (Be careful not to let the virus concentrate in the last pockets to freeze.) Frozen material probably changes little over the period of the study. Use that same batch for the entire study. Chip off parts to dose subjects, and use volume to measure dose. Thaw and add water at the last minute to produce very small doses. Save some of the batch for studies that compare it with future batches.Spacing \u2013 At one extreme we could just have three different doses, with a third of subjects getting each. At another extreme, each subject could get a different dose.  This latter approach gives the most data to estimate ideal dosage, but it also makes the data harder to analyze. Whether we have just three doses or a wide range, we need good ways to pick the ends of the dose range.Adaption \u2013 We could either just randomly assign subjects doses from our chosen set, or use an adaptive learning process to respond to previous results, searching for the lowest doses that give a sufficient high chance of infection. An interesting option is to start everyone on a low dose, and then escalate their dose until infection is achieved. The longer we must wait to verify a lack of infection, the longer this approach would take.Delivery \u2013 Dosing via liquid volume fits with several ways to deliver this dose to a subject. Subjects could drink the water, drip it on their eyes, inject it, use a nasal spray, squirt it into their rectum, or swallow a pill. We want a delivery method that we guess will produce a less severe infection, but is also easy and cheap for others to reliably apply later. If we have enough subjects, we might also vary delivery along with dose in an initial trial.Infection \u2013 When we use the lowest doses, subjects are likely to fail to get infected at all. We\u2019d like a fast reliable way to check this, so that if we waited long enough and saw no infection, we could try them again with a higher dose. Their results will be available a bit later than others, but are still valuable. So we\u2019ll need access to fast-enough reliable-enough covid tests, and maybe ~50% more of them than we have subjects. We need even more tests if we use them to measure recovery.Jurisdiction \u2013 It is a big world, so in principle one could shop around for the place with the most favorable legal liability, professional licensing rules, and other regulatory treatment. Alas, this choice interacts strongly with choices of patrons, sponsors, subjects, and staff. Does a medical cruise ship help?Location \u2013 Compared to many other medical trials, in this one there is a priority on isolating subjects so they don\u2019t infect others. Can we trust subjects told to stay isolated at home to do so? Or is it better to rent a hotel, dorms, or other place to better enforce isolation? This place doesn\u2019t have to be especially medical, but we need to make frequent medical measurements, and we\u2019d need subjects to have access to advanced medical care for worse case scenarios. Do organizations who provide such care need to approve and join this project?Synergies \u2013 There may be big synergies from combining this trial with others, such as trials of particular anti-virals or vaccine candidates. As long as we are doing to infect people anyway, first give them a vaccine candidate to see if that helps. But it may take longer to find a willing trial partner and to coordinate with them, and the data analysis may get more complex.Okay, that\u2019s what I have so far. If you mention issues I should have included, I\u2019ll add them.","38":" Travel Made Humans  I hadn\u2019t till now appreciated how central long distance travel was to early human evolution. A 2004 Nature article:No primates other than humans are capable of endurance running. \u2026 Well-conditioned human runners \u2026 can occasionally outrun horses over the extremely long distances that constrain these animals to optimal galloping speeds, typically a canter. \u2026 Horses have \u2026 narrow ranges of preferred speeds for trotting and galloping and gait transitions that minimize cost. \u2026 Human runners differ from horses in employing a single gait. \u2026 Humans are thus able to adjust running speed continuously without change of gait or metabolic penalty over a wide range of speeds. \u2026Considering all the evidence together, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Homo evolved to travel long distances by both walking and running\u2026 Endurance running is not common among modern hunter-gatherers, who employ many technologies to hunt (for example, bows and arrows, nets and spearthrowers), thereby minimizing the need to run long distances. But Carrier has hypothesized that endurance running evolved in early hominids for predator pursuit before these inventions in the Upper Palaeolithic (about 40kya). Endurance running may have helped hunters get close enough to throw projectiles, or perhaps even to run some mammals to exhaustion in the heat. \u2026Another hypothesis to explore is \u2026 in the open, semi-arid environments \u2026 early Homo may \u2026 have needed to run long distances to compete with other scavengers, including other hominids. \u2026 Similar strategies of \u2018pirating\u2019 meat from carnivores are sometimes practised by the Hadza in East Africa. \u2026 It is known that major increases in encephalization occurred only after the appearance of early Homo. \u2026 Endurance running may have made possible a diet rich in fats and proteins thought to account for the unique human combination of large bodies, small guts, big brains and small teeth.A 2009 Evolutionary Anthropology article on \u201cThe Emergence of Human Uniqueness\u201dImportant preadaptations in the genus Homo \u2026 led to human uniqueness. First, hominins are bipedal and, as a result, cover geographical ranges far larger than other apes do. Even hunter-gatherers living in tropical forests have daily home ranges that are two to three times those of chimpanzees, and lifetime home ranges more than two orders of magnitude greater. Thus, individual hominins faced more environmental variability than do chimpanzees. \u2026 This would favor social learning capacity.Second, bipedal hominins evolved exceptional manual dexterity because their hands were freed from locomotory constraints, and they could carry tools with little cost. This would have favored increased tool using and making behavior and probably increased selection pressure on imitative capacities as well. Third, by at least 2 million years ago, hominins had begun to depend on high-quality, widely dispersed resources that were difficult to obtain. This shift of feeding niche had important life-history implications. Juveniles could not fully feed themselves due to the complexity of the extractive niche, and this led to their provisioning by close kin. As large package foods became common, the foods returned to the juvenile home base were probably \u2018\u2018shared\u2019\u2019 by coresidents. This \u2026. might partially explain why hunter-gatherers experience early adult mortality at one-\ufb01fth the rate of wild chimpanzees. That pattern would favor a life history with later age at maturity and delayed onset of senescence. \u2026Here we present a possible chronological sequence of related adaptations that form a set of working hypotheses for future research:A. Bipedality led to manipulative dexterity, low-cost transport, and larger home range. These traits favored more extensive tool use and greater selection for social learning capacities. The transition to larger social groupings is clearly evident by [~60-24kya], including a shift toward central place foraging and increasingly distant resource forays among all hominins of western Eurasia at least. Oldowan tools indicate abilities not present in other apes. Amplified home range was a critical preadaptation for the subsequent dietary shift to widely dispersed but nutrient- dense resources.B. Dietary shift to a hunted and extracted diet created juvenile dependence on adult provisioning. This promoted kin-based cooperative breeding along with evolution of early prosocial emotions, enhanced theory of mind, shared intentionality, and more complex communication that facilitated task specialization and integration of the shared goals of cooperative breeders. The emergence of a home-base economic system allowed adults debilitated by ill- ness and injury to recover, favoring later senescence and later sexual maturity.C. Imitative capacity and shared intentionality interacted to produce cumulative cultural capacity. This relied on a pedagogical mode of interaction in which imitators presumed that models were motivated to help rather than compete with them. \u2026D. Cumulative cultural capacity and prosocial emotions led to language, social norms, ethnicity, and extensive nonkin cooperation. This allowed the emergence of social norms regulating mate exchange between kin groups and promoted intergroup peaceful interaction due to cross-cutting genetic interests, as well as the emergence of gifting and trading. Because of the increase in effective interacting group size \u2026 cultural accumulation sped up enormously.Finally, an interesting 1999 theory:Extensive nonkin cooperation [led] to all major elements of human uniqueness. Coalitional enforcement arose uniquely in humans when the animals that founded the Homo clade acquired the ability to kill or injure conspecifics from a substantial distance. This resulted from the evolution of hominid virtuosity at accurate, high-momentum throwing and clubbing, previously supposed to be adaptations for hunting, predator defense or individual aggression. No previous animal could reliably kill or injure conspecifics remotely. This ability dramatically reduced the individual cost of punishing noncooperative behavior by allowing these costs to be distributed among multiple cooperator.","39":" School Isn\u2019t For Learning  A few years ago, Peter Gray blogged some provocative claims:Foragers don\u2019t distinguish work from play:Hunter-gatherers do not have a concept of toil. When they do have that concept, it derives apparently from their contact with outsiders. \u2026 Their own work is simply an extension of children\u2019s play. Children play at hunting, gathering, hut construction, tool making, meal preparations, defense against predators, birthing, infant care, healing, negotiation, and so on and so on; and gradually, as their play become increasingly skilled, the activities become productive. \u2026 work is play for four main reasons: (1) It is varied and requires much skill and intelligence. (2) There is not too much of it. (3) It is done in a social context, with friends. And (4) (most significantly) it is, for any given person at any given time, optional. \u2026Hunter-gatherers\u2019 work somewhere between 20 and 40 hours a week, on average, depending on just what you count as work. Moreover, they do not work according to the clock; they work when the time is ripe for the work to be done and when they feel like it. There is ample time in hunter-gatherers\u2019 lives for leisure activities, including games of many sorts, playful religious ceremonies, making and playing musical instruments, singing, dancing, traveling to other bands to visit friends and relatives, gossiping, and just lying around and relaxing. (more)Foragers kids learn without being taught:Hunter-gatherers lived in small nomadic bands (of about 25 to 50 people per band), made decisions democratically, had ethical systems that centered on egalitarian values and sharing, and had rich cultural traditions that included music, art, games, dances, and time-honored stories. \u2026 [We] contacted a number of anthropologists who had lived among hunter-gatherers and asked them to respond to a written questionnaire about their observations of children\u2019s lives. \u2026[Our] four conclusions: \u2026 1. Hunter-gatherer children must learn an enormous amount to become successful adults. \u2026 2. The children learn all this without being taught. \u2026 Occasionally an adult might offer a word of advice or demonstrate how to do something better, such as how to shape an arrowhead, but such help is given only when the child clearly desires it. Adults do not initiate, direct, or interfere with children\u2019s activities. \u2026 3. The children are afforded enormous amounts of time to play and explore. \u2026 \u201c[Batek] children were free to play nearly all the time; no one expected children to do serious work until they were in their late teens.\u201d \u2026 4. Children observe adults\u2019 activities and incorporate those activities into their play. \u2026 Nobody has to tell or encourage the children to do all this. They do it naturally because, like children everywhere, there is nothing that they desire more than to grow up and to be like the successful adults that they see around them. (more)This \u201cfree school\u201d approach works today:In fifty years \u2026 people will wonder why the world took so long to come to grips with such a simple and self-evident idea as that upon which the Sudbury Valley School is founded: Children educate themselves; we don\u2019t have to do it for them.\u2026 [Sudbury] admits students without regard to any measures of academic performance, and it operates at a per pupil cost that is about half that of the surrounding public schools. The [40 year old] school currently has about 200 students and ten adult staff members. \u2026 In one-person-one-vote fashion, [all students and staff] meet once a week, create all of the school\u2019s rules, \u2026 and hires and fires staff members. \u2026Students are free, all day, every day, to do what they wish at the school. \u2026 None of the school\u2019s rules have to do with learning. The school gives no tests. It does not evaluate or grade students\u2019 progress.[1] There is no curriculum and no attempt to motivate students to learn. \u2026 Several studies of graduates \u2026. have shown that the school works well as an educational institution. Graduates \u2026 had no particular difficulties getting into colleges \u2026 or performing well there. \u2026 Former students \u2026 are almost unanimous in reporting that they are glad that they attended. \u2026[1] Students who wish to graduate with a high school diploma must prepare a written thesis defending the statement that they have prepared themselves for responsible adult life. That thesis is defended orally and evaluated by a panel of adults. (more)Modern childhood and schools have other purposes:With the rise of agriculture, and later of industry, children became forced laborers. Play and exploration were suppressed. Willfulness, which had been a virtue, became a vice that had to be beaten out of children. \u2026 Successful farming required long hours of relatively unskilled, repetitive labor, much of which could be done by children. With larger families, children had to work in the fields to help feed their younger siblings, or they had to work at home to help care for those siblings. \u2026Employers in industry saw schooling as a way to create better workers. To them, the most crucial lessons were punctuality, following directions, tolerance for long hours of tedious work, and a minimal ability to read and write. From their point of view (though they may not have put it this way), the duller the subjects taught in schools the better. (more)Gray is mostly right: forager kids learn all they need when free to play all day, forager adults work all they need without toiling, and kids can learn modern skills this way today. But there is no net trend toward free schools, and I expect a wholesale move would be a disaster. Yes, it works for some students, including most who stay until they graduate at free schools, but parents of kids for whom it doesn\u2019t work probably pull their kids out.  And free school graduates probably avoid the ugly jobs schools were designed to make kids accept.  School isn\u2019t about learning \u201cmaterial,\u201d school is about learning to accept workplace domination and ranking, and tolerating long hours of doing boring stuff exactly when and how you are told. Others seem to agree:There used to be thousands of \u201cfree\u201d schools back in the 1960s and 1970s, \u2026 The number has waned since, although \u2026 many of their ideas are used in public alternative schools and by some homeschooling families. \u2026 There are about 200 \u201cdemocratic\u201d schools around the world, including the Sudbury schools. \u2026 Many say the Sudbury model is not \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a great model for some students \u2014 but I would say that for every kind of education.\u201d (more)","40":" Is Carbon Lost Cause?  Browsing a Royal Society Phil Trans special issue on geo-engineering and reading a paper by Lane and Montgomery tempts me to ask: is carbon a lost cause?After twenty years of laborious efforts, the plain truth is that greenhouse gas [GHG] control proposals have so far failed to move the needle on global emissions. Even in Europe, where the social consensus for GHG reduction is supposedly strongest, emissions continue to grow.  Where GHG emissions have fallen, underlying changes in economic structure may have played a bigger role than climate policy. \u2026.Global emissions must fall to roughly twenty percent of business as usual projections by mid to late century, if the goal is stabilization at 550 ppm CO2 \u2026  Existing GHG-free energy technologies, and incremental improvements to them, cannot accommodate this growth at realistic costs. \u2026 Even if \u2026 signatories had lived up to their commitments, the [Kyoto Protocol]\u2019s impact on global temperature would have been trivial. \u2026For America, Kyoto \u2026 very likely made compliance a net loss. \u2026 The fact that Russia is again refusing to accept even a nominal GHG cap points to that country\u2019s deep lack of enthusiasm for the entire venture of international controls. \u2026 Initially advocates of unilateral controls argued that, if the U.S. adopted GHG limits, China and would promptly follow suit. However, during the Clinton Administration, the U.S. offered to adopt GHG limits if China and India did likewise, and China and India spurned the offer. \u2026[For] the spread of Green ideology \u2026 to work with GHG control, the same or equivalent Green world view must take root in the populations of all major emitting nations. \u2026 A very long process of social transformation would be required before the hoped for culture shift could possibly become widespread enough to make a difference. \u2026If progress is defined only as movement toward global cap-and-trade with universal adherence to strict targets and timetable, prospects are bleak. \u2026 Some form of muddling through has much better prospects. \u2026 agreement on a set of specific actions that each country will take contingent on others doing the same \u2026 This pledge and review process is unlikely to produce large and immediate reductions in GHG emissions.Sure, many feel \"something must be done\" about carbon emissions, and \"something\" will be done, perhaps even at substantial cost.  But the world is eager to consume the vast tasty feast that is our oil, coal, and natural gas reserves, and unless a world war installs a world government to police a green ideology inquisition, it seems feast we will.  Politically feasible policies might delay this by a decade or two, but without a drastic revolution it seems all that carbon will go into the air over the next century or two. (Might I be wrong? I\u2019d love to defer to decision markets here.)Artificial volcanoes or cloud-seeding ships seem so cheap that if allowed they\u2019ll likely stop disastrous warming, though heat redistributions may hurt.  But it seems hard to avoid carbon emissions making oceans more acidic, and so without drastic improvements in carbon sequestering, we\u2019ll likely kill most coral reefs and dependent ecosystems.  These are real losses, but note we could probably more than compensate for lower fish catches via serious property rights in ocean fishing.  And let\u2019s not forget, our descendants should be quite rich overall, in part from that carbon feasting; most could afford a few disruptions.  Bottom line: as with rising medical costs, it seems politicians can\u2019t win by solving the problem; they can only deflect blame for failure.  You might think \"Maybe prospects are dim, but we have to start somewhere, right?\"  No, when a cause is lost it can be better to switch to not-yet-lost causes.Concern about the distant future is so rare, and that future so important, it seems a shame to waste it on carbon if that cause is lost.  If your concern about global warming wasn\u2019t just symbolic displeasure at tech or materialism, and you really were willing to work today to help folks in a century or two, consider instead saving for them, preparing for our new robot overlords, or making futarchy real.","41":" Why Info Push Dominates  Some phenomena to ponder:Decades ago I gave talks about how the coming world wide web (which we then called \u201chypertext publishing\u201d) could help people find more info. Academics would actually reply \u201cI don\u2019t need any info tools; my associates will personally tell me about any research worth knowing about.\u201dMany said the internet would bring a revolution of info pull, where people pay to get the specific info they want, to supplant the info push of ads, where folks pay to get their messages heard. But even Google gets most revenue from info pushers, and our celebrated social media mainly push info too.Blog conversations put a huge premium on arguments that appear quickly after other arguments. Mostly arguments that appear by themselves a few weeks later might as well not exist, for all they\u2019ll influence future expressed opinions.When people hear negative rumors about others, they usually believe them, and rarely ask the accused directly for their side of the story. This makes it easy to slander folks who aren\u2019t well connected enough to have friends who will tell them who said what about them.We usually don\u2019t seem to correct well for \u201cindependent\u201d confirming clues that actually come from the same source a few steps back. We also tolerate higher status folks dominating meetings and other communication channels, thereby counting their opinions more. So ad campaigns often have time-correlated channel-redundant bursts with high status associations.Overall, we tend to wait for others to push info onto us, rather than taking the initiative to pull info in, and we tend to gullibly believe such pushed clues, especially when they come from high status folks, come redundantly, and come correlated in time.A simple explanation of all this is that our mental habits were designed to get us to accept the opinions of socially well-connected folks. Such opinions may be more likely to be true, but even if not they are more likely to be socially convenient. Pushed info tends to come with the meta clues of who said it when and via what channel. In contrast, pulled info tends to drop many such meta clues, making it harder to covertly adopt the opinions of the well-connected.","42":"2 No Recent Automation Revolution  Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you know that for many years the media has been almost screaming that we entering a big automation revolution, with huge associated job losses, due to new AI tech, especially deep learning. The media has cited many \u201cexperts\u201d making such claims, most every management consulting firm has felt compelled to issue a related report, and the subject came up in the Democratic US presidential debates.Last December, Keller Scholl and I posted a working paper suggesting that this whole narrative is bullshit, at least so far. An automation revolution driven by a new kind of automation tech should induce changes in the total amount and rate of automation, and in which kinds of jobs get more automated. But looking at all U.S. jobs 1999-2019, we find no change whatsoever in the kinds of jobs more likely to be automated. We don\u2019t even see a net change in overall level of automation, though language habits may be masking such changes. And having a job get more automated is not correlated at all with changes in its pay or employment. (There may be effects in narrow categories, like jobs that use robots, but nothing visible at the overall level of all automation.)Two metrics created by groups trying to predict which jobs will get automated soon did predict past automaton, but not after we included 25 mundane job features like Pace Determined By Speed Of Equipment and Importance of Repeating Same Tasks, which together predict over half of the variance in job automation. The main change over the last two decades may be that job tasks have gradually become more suitable for automation, because nearby tasks have become automated.Our paper has so far received zero media attention, even though it contradicts a lot of quite high visibility media hype, which continues on at the same rate. It has now been officially published in a respected peer reviewed journal: Economics Letters. Will that induce more media coverage? Probably not, as most of those other papers got media attention before they were peer reviewed. The pattern seems to be that hype gets covered, contradictory deflations of hype do not. Unless of course the deflation comes from someone prestigious enough.For Economics Letters we had to greatly compress the paper. Here is the new 40 word abstract:Wages and employment predict automation in 832 U.S. jobs, 1999 to 2019, but add little to top 25 O*NET job features, whose best predictive model did not change over this period. Automation changes predict changes in neither wages nor employment.And Highlights:25 simple job features explain over half the variance in which jobs are how automated.The strongest job automation predictor is: Pace Determined By Speed Of Equipment.Which job features predict job automation how did not change from 1999 to 2019.Jobs that get more automated do not on average change in pay or employment.Labor markets change more often due to changes in demand, relative to supply.","43":" Neglected Conflicts  We tend to neglect our advisors\u2019 conflicts of interest, especially in immediate face-to-face interactions, and especially when such conflicts are disclosed to us:Certain study participants were required to make an estimate \u2014 evaluating the prices of houses, for instance. Meanwhile, other participants were \u2026 given additional information with which to advise the estimators. When these experts were put in a conflicted situation \u2014 they were paid according to how high the estimator guessed \u2014 they gave worse advice than if they were paid according to the accuracy of the estimate. \u2026 When the researchers required the experts to disclose this conflict to the people they were advising. \u2026 It actually caused them to inflate their numbers even more.Experiments focusing on doctor-patient interactions, in which a doctor prescribes a medication but discloses a financial interest in the company that makes the drug. As expected, most people said such a disclosure would decrease their trust in the advice. But in practice, oddly enough, people were actually more likely to comply with the advice when the doctor\u2019s bias was disclosed. \u2026 [Perhaps] people feel an increased pressure to take the advice to avoid insinuating that they distrust their doctor. ..People who are prescribed medicines by personal doctors are less likely to recognize the potential dangers of their doctors\u2019 conflict of interest. \u2026 People were more likely to discount biased advice from doctors if disclosures were made by a third party, if they were not made face-to-face, or if patients had a \u201ccooling off\u201d period to reconsider their decisions. \u2026 Even if these fixes make disclosure more effective, \u2026 transparency is not a blanket solution to problems of corruption. \u201cRegulators should be looking harder at eliminating conflicts.\u201d (more)As with other products, we may care more about affiliating well with our advisors, especially high status ones, than we do about getting good deals from them.Yes, regulators who want to help should push to better align advisor interests. But regulators and the politicians to whom they report also have conflicts of interest, and the above studies suggests that voters will also neglect such conflicts. Also, in a democracy regulators hands will be tied by voter perceptions of where the problems lie.  For example, since voters are more concerned about for-profit insurance company conflicts than about high status doctor conflicts, voters push regulators to limit insurer abilities to counter doctor conflicts.  And money-averse voters would probably oppose more extreme ways to use money to align doctor incentives more with patients.","44":" Regulatory Differences  I recently discussed a puzzling regulatory difference: our applying work hour limits less to high than low status jobs. Many took me to be advocating fewer limits for low status jobs, and were eager to point out good reasons for work hour limits. But our not having a good reason for putting more work hour limits on high vs. low status jobs can equally well support adding more limits to high status jobs, rather than fewer limits on low status jobs.John Cochrane similarly discussed a puzzling regulatory difference:Ken Rogoff put in this little zingerMedical care \u2026 fails to satisfy several of the basic requirements necessary for the price mechanism to produce economic efficiency, beginning with the difficulty that consumers have in assessing the quality of their treatment.\u2026 really, Et tu Ken? It\u2019s hard to know if the car mechanic is doing a good job. Get ready for the Federal takeover of the car industry. I can\u2019t tell B grade exterior from A grade interior plywood, so we need a Federal takeover of home rehab.Many readers probably take this as an argument for less medical regulation, and are eager to argue for or against that position. But pointing out that we have a similar difficulty assessing car mechanic and doctor quality can equally well argue for regulating car mechanics more, instead of regulating doctors less.In general, people seem far more eager to collect respectable arguments for or against various specific regulations, than to consider the coherence of a pattern of regulations they endorse. They are satisfied to offer arguments for why janitors should have work hour limits, why musicians should not, why doctors should be highly regulated, and why car mechanics should not, all without much noticing or caring how much they treat similar cases differently.This suggests that there is a lot of rationalization going on. That is, rather than choosing some principles and then consistently applying them, people instead pick various random policy positions and then search for justifications. There seems to be only weak pressures to even notice much less reduce how they and their arguments treat similar things differently.","45":" Inequality Talk Is About Grabbing  The US today has about 425 billionaires, over 1\/3 of the world\u2019s total. Many folks say these billionaires are unfairly unequal, and so we should tax them lots more.People usually become billionaires via having \u201csuper-powers,\u201d i.e., very unusual abilities, at least within some context. But what if most billionaires had super-powers of the traditional comic book sort, like x-ray vision or an ability to fly, etc.? That is, what if people with physical super-powers earned billions in the labor market by selling the use of these powers? Would folks be just as eager to tax them to reduce unfair inequality?My guess is no, most would be less eager to tax billionaires with physical super-powers. And I offer this prediction as a test of my favored theory of expressed inequality concerns: that inequality talk is usually a covert way of coordinating who to maybe grab stuff from. Let me explain.As I\u2019ve discussed before, while people usually justify their inequality concerns by noting that inequality can make lower folks feel bad, that justification can apply equally to a great many sorts of inequality. Yet concern is actually only voiced about a very particular sort: financial inequality at a given time between the families of a nation. The puzzle in need of explaining is: why is so little concern expressed about all the other sorts of inequality?My favored theory is an application of homo hypocritus: our forager ancestors developed the ability to express and enforce social norms, and then developed rich and subtle abilities to coordinate to evade those norms. One of those norms was that foragers weren\u2019t supposed to grab stuff from each other just because they wanted the stuff, or just because that stuff was easy to grab. But they did have norms favoring sharing and equal treatment, and so it was ok to talk about who might be violating such norms, and what punishments to apply to violators.But they all knew, at least subconsciously, that some groups would be quite effective at retaliating against such suggestions. The accused might physically resist the attempted punishment, or might retaliate with contrary accusations. So foragers needed ways not only to overtly accuse folks of violating norms, and to officially propose to take stuff away as punishment, but also to covertly discuss who might have especially nice stuff to take, and who they could most easily get away with grabbing from.I suggest that most talk about the problems of inequality actually invokes this ancient hypocritical ability to covertly discuss where to find lots of nice easy-to-grab stuff. We don\u2019t discuss inequalities across time, because it is hard to grab much more than we do from the past or the future. We don\u2019t much discuss the inequality of rich foreigners, because it is much harder to grab their stuff. We don\u2019t much discuss inequality of those with unusual artistic abilities or sexual attractiveness, because we can\u2019t directly grab their advantages and while we might try to grab their material goods to compensate, they don\u2019t have that much, and the grabbing would be hard. (Also, such folks have more social status to resist with. For foragers, status counted lots more than material goods for influence.)A few people within our nation who each have lots and lots of material goods, however, seem to make a great target for grabbing. So people discover they have a deep moral concern about that particular inequality, and ponder what oh what could we possibly do to rectify this situation? Anyone have an idea? Anyone?But if those few very rich folks had real physical super-powers, we would be a lot more afraid of their simple physical retaliation. They might be very effective at physically resisting our attempts to take their stuff. So somehow, conveniently, we just wouldn\u2019t find that their unequal wealth evoked as much deeply felt important-social-issue-in-need-of-discussing moral concern in us. Because, I hypothesize, in reality those feelings only arise as a cover to excuse our grabbing, when such grabs seem worth the bother.","46":" Taming The Wild Idea  Foragers distinguish between camp and the wild. In camp, things are safe and comfortable, and people should be pleasant. The wild, in contrast, is dangerous and uncontrolled. In camp, some of us must watch out for intrusions from wild, such as storms, wild animals, or hostile tribes.Some of us must also periodically venture into the wild, to bring back food and other useful materials. But it is important that whatever we bring back be tamed before it gets here. Don\u2019t bring back live dangerous animals, don\u2019t leave poison berries around camp where people might think they are safe, and leave violent aggressive hunt habits out there in the wild. What happens in the wild, should stay in the wild.Ideas and concepts can be dangerous and disruptive. Ideas influence the status and attractiveness of people and activities, and who is blamed and credited for what outcomes. For a society vulnerable to social disruption, ideas can be wild.Today, most of the ideas and concepts that we come across have been tamed. They have long been integrated into our ways of thinking, and we have worked out attitudes and opinions to help us avoid being cut by their sharp edges.But today we must also deal with a steady stream of new untamed ideas. Some of these are the side effect of ordinary people doing ordinary things. Others come from intellectual explorers, who purposely venture into the wild in search of new ideas. How do we tame such ideas?We celebrate our intellectual explorers, both those who come back with useful ideas, and those whose useless ideas show off their impressive explorer abilities. But we are also wary of their trophies, just as foragers would be way of a hunter bringing a strange live animal into camp. We want people we trust and respect to tame those ideas before let them flow free in our camp of easily discussed ideas. Wild explorers, who may have \u201cgone native\u201d, can be useful in expeditions, but must remain under the control of more civilized explorers.I think this helps us understand why universities, some of the most conservative institutions we have, are home to our most celebrated intellectuals. Academic institutions such as universities, academic journals, peer review, etc. seem far from ideal ways to encourage innovative ideas. But they seem like better ways to ensure outsiders that ideas have been safely tamed. The new ideas that academics endorse can be safely quoted and an applied with minimal risk of wild uncontrolled disruption. So when ideas originate among wild untamed academic-outsiders, we prefer to attribute them to the safe academic insiders who tame them.When we are willing to risk being exposed to wild untamed ideas, we turn less to academics, and more to startup companies, passionate writers, activists, etc. And in our youth, many of us are eager for such exposure, to show that we are no longer children who must stay safely in camp \u2013 we are strong and brave enough to venture into the wild.But when we get children of our own, and feel less a need to show off our derring-do, we prefer tamed idea sources. We prefer to hire kids who got their ideas from universities, not startups or activists. And most prefer their news to come from similarly tamed journalists. We applaud wild ideas, but prefer them tamed.","47":" Eternal Medicine  Most fans of modern medicine do not realize how similar in appearance was ancient medicine:While the Greeks left a vast legacy of medical texts in a familiar language, we know of only 12 from the time of the pharaohs \u2013 written on papyrus in a vanished language that scholars are still grappling with. From their descriptions of diseases and treatments, the texts have left little doubt that the ancient Egyptians had considerable medical skills, but weighing up their pharmaceutical knowledge has proved trickier: although the papyri include some 2000 prescriptions, doubts surround the identity of many of the ingredients listed. \u2026.Focusing on four key papyri, which contain 1000 prescriptions and date from 1850 BC to around 1200 BC, Campbell analysed each prescription and compared it with contemporary standards and protocols. \u2026 After five years of painstaking analyses, \u2026 Of the original 1000 prescriptions, she could now say exactly how 550 were made and whether they would work. For another 156, she knew all but a minor ingredient \u2013 enough to say if the remedy worked. \u2026The Egyptians\u2019 choice of ingredients has certainly stood the test of time. When Campbell consulted Martindale\u2019s Extra Pharmacopoeia \u2013 the 1977 edition, when drugs were still prepared in a dispensary \u2013 she found that 62 per cent of ingredients named in the papyri were still in use in the 1970s.  \u2026 The formulations stood comparison too. Checking against the 1973 British Pharmaceutical Codex, which lays down standards and protocols for making up medicines, Campbell found 67 per cent of the ancient Egyptian remedies complied, with one proviso \u2013 the Egyptians knew nothing of the need for sterility. \u2026 They had enemas, draughts and linctuses, lotions and liniments, creams, ointments and mouthwashes. \u2026. Ignorant of the causes of most diseases, ancient Egyptian doctors inevitably focused on symptoms. \u2026Knowing the drug, the dose, how it was to be administered and what it was prescribed for meant it was possible to compare its effectiveness with modern remedies. Campbell was impressed. \"Sixty-four per cent of the prescriptions had therapeutic value on a par with drugs used in the past 50 years. In many cases even the dosing was right.\"As long as he was arrogant, wore a white coat, put his drugs in capsules, and spoke the local language, I doubt most people today could tell the difference if they were treated by an ancient Egyptian doctor.  By the way, the oldest known successful brain surgery was 8000BC.","48":" Wanted: Know-It-Some Critics  Last November I said I wanted to write a book on a complex subject, but found it hard to simultaneously work out what I think on the subject, and to also write so as to engage a wide audience well. I wondered why book authors don\u2019t do this in two steps:First I\u2019d write a pre-book, which states my main claims and arguments directly and clearly, using expert language, for an expert audience. I\u2019d then circulate that pre-book privately among experts and useful thinkers of various sorts, seeking criticism of my arguments. Then using their feedback, I\u2019d revise my claims and arguments, and write an engaging accessible book that can be circulated widely. (more)Well even though few ever do this, I decided to try it anyway. And I now have a 62,000 word book draft, on the subject of em econ (see posts,Tedx video), i.e., on the social implications of a world dominated by brain-emulation-based AI. This draft isn\u2019t especially fun or readable, or engaging to a wide audience. But it isn\u2019t terrible, and seems a sufficient basis for eliciting thoughtful criticism.I\u2019ve asked around within my private social network, gotten some good feedback, and changed my draft lots in response. But I\u2019d feel irresponsible if didn\u2019t seek more critics. So let me put it out there: who wants to read and comment on my book draft?Now I don\u2019t want to post the draft publicly; I might want to sell it as a separate book later. So I don\u2019t want to just give it to anyone who asks; I need to set a non-trivial standard. And the standard I\u2019ve picked is: you should know something about something.My book is on how the world changes if a certain tech gets cheap: computer-based emulations of human brains. And my analysis suggests that this changes many aspects of society. To give you some idea of relevant topics, I\u2019ve included a current book outline below the fold.So to be a useful critic, you should know something about brains, computers, business, or some other important part of our social world. You don\u2019t need a Ph.D. of course; most knowledge in our world isn\u2019t held by Ph.D.s. Years of experience can work wonders. But on the subjects you understand, you should know lots more than does a typical high school graduate on a typical subject, i.e., almost nothing.

We are sorry, but the NSF\u2019s new rules for promoting progress give us no choice but to reject you.\u201dKumar: \u201cSo I\u2019m too pigheaded to be a scientist?\u201dJones: \u201cNo, you are not pigheaded enough. You are too likely to objectively evaluate research on its methods, rather than on whether its conclusions match your previous positions. You are too willing to change your mind when evidence changes.\u201dKumar: \u201cBut isn\u2019t such objectivity a scientific ideal?\u201dJones: \u201cWell some say so, but the wise know otherwise. If all scientists were like you, they\u2019d agree too much, and all work on the same projects. For robust scientific progress, we need different scientists to work on different projects. And to get that, we need them to pigheadedly draw different conclusions from the same data.\u201dKumar: \u201cBut our modern economy is based on a vast specialization of labor. Are you saying that modern economies would be impossible without us all being pigheaded, because otherwise we\u2019d all do the same job? Can\u2019t we just pay people to do different jobs?\u201dJones: \u201cMoney might motivate ordinary people to do different jobs, but in the magestarium of science money matters not. Scientists only pick research topics based on scientific beliefs. So to get different research, we need different beliefs.\u201dPretty crazy, right? Behold this oped by Cordelia Fine in Saturday\u2019s New York Times:Scientists \u2026 rated the paper\u2019s methodology, data presentation and scientific contribution significantly more favorably when the paper happened to offer results consistent with their own theoretical stance. \u2026 This is a worry. Doesn\u2019t the ideal of scientific reasoning \u2026 shun the ego-driven desire to prevail over our critics \u2026 ? Perhaps not. Some academics have recently suggested that a scientist\u2019s pigheadedness and social prejudices can peacefully coexist with \u2014 and may even facilitate \u2014 the pursuit of scientific knowledge. \u2026An irrational tendency like pigheadedness can be quite an asset in an argumentative context. A engages with B and proposes X. B disagrees and counters with Y. Reverse roles, repeat as desired \u2014 and what in the old days we might have mistaken for an exercise in stubbornness turns out instead to be a highly efficient \u201cdivision of cognitive labor\u201d with A specializing in the pros, B in the cons. It\u2019s salvation of a kind: \u2026 by way of positive side effect, these heated social interactions, when they occur within a scientific community, can lead to the discovery of the truth. (more; HT Eric Schliesser)This idea that humans disagree because disagreement is good for society, by getting people to take different actions, is an old one. I\u2019m rather skeptical about it in general, and especially regarding academic research. Academics are easily motivated by money and other personal perks, and if such payments are insufficient, I see no advantages to a diversity of beliefs that a diversity of values can\u2019t supply. Given enough value diversity, I see no net social gain from folks being unwilling to update based on evidence.","50":" \u201cI Robot, You Unemployed\u201d  Tomorrow (Wednesday) at 7pm EST I\u2019ll do a Learn Liberty Live! web presentation on \u201cI, Robot.

Herodotus 440bcOver the eons, we humans have greatly increased our transportation abilities. Long ago, we mostly walked everywhere. Then over time, we accumulated more ways to move ourselves and goods faster, cheaper, and more reliably, from boats to horses to gondolas to spaceships. Today, for most points A and B, our total cost to move from A to B is orders of magnitude cheaper than it would be via walking.Even so, walking remains an important part of our transport portfolio. While we are able to move people who can\u2019t walk, such as via wheelchairs, that is expensive and limiting. Yet while walking still matters, improvements in walking have contributed little to our long term gains in transport abilities. Most gains came instead from other transport methods. Most walking gains even came from other areas. For example, we can now walk better due to better boots, lighting, route planners, and paved walkways. Our ability to walk without such aids has improved much less.As with transport, so with many other areas of life. Our ancient human abilities still matter, but most gains over time have come from other improvements. This applies to both physical and social tech. That is, to our space-time arrangements of physical materials and objects, and also to our arrangements of human actions, info and incentives.Social scientists often use the term \u201cinstitutions\u201d broadly to denote relatively stable components social arrangements of actions, info and incentives. Some of the earliest human institutions were language and social norms. We have modestly improved human languages, such as via expanded syntax forms and vocabulary. And over history humans have experimented with a great range of social norms, and also with new ways to enforce them, such as oaths, law, and CCTV.We still rely greatly on social norms to manage small families, work groups and friend groups. As with walking, while we could probably manage such groups in other ways, doing so would be expensive and limiting. So social norms still matter. But as with our walking, relatively little of our gains overtime has come from improving our ancient institution of social norms.When humans moved to new environments, such as marshes or antic tundra, they had to adapt their generic walking methods to these new contexts. No doubt learning and innovation was involved in that process. Similarly, we no doubt continue to evolve our social norms and their methods of enforcement to deal with changing social contexts. Even so, social norm innovation seems a small part of total institutional innovation over the eons.With walking, we seem well aware that walking innovation has only been a small part of total transport innovation. But we humans were built to at least pretend to care a lot about social norms. We consider opinions on and adherence to norms, and the shared values they support, to be central to saying who are \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d people, and who we see as in \u201cour people\u201d. So we make norms central to our political fights. And we put great weight on norms when evaluating which societies are good, and whether the world has gotten better over time.Thus each society tends to see its own origin, and the changes which led to its current norms, as enormously important and positive historical events. But if we stand outside any one society and consider the overall sweep of history, we can\u2019t automatically count these as big contributions to long term innovation. After all, the next society is likely to change norms yet again. Most innovation is in accumulating improvements in all those other social institutions.Now it is true that we have seen some consistent trends in attitudes and norms over the last few centuries. But wealth has also been rising, and having humans attitudes be naturally conditional on wealth levels seems a much better explanation of this fact than the theory that after a million years of human evolution we suddenly learned how to learn about norms. Yes it is good to adapt norms to changing conditions, but as conditions will likely change yet again, we can\u2019t count that as long term innovation.In sum: most innovation comes in additions to basic human capacities, not in tweaks to those original capacities. Most transport innovation is not in improved ways to walk, and most social institution innovation is not in better social norms. Even if each society would like to tell itself otherwise. To help the future the most, search more for better institutions, less for better norms.","52":" Solar Savior  Averaged over 30 years, the trend is for an annual 7 percent reduction in the dollars per watt of solar photovoltaic cells. \u2026 In the lab, researchers have achieved solar efficiencies of as high as 41 percent, an unheard of efficiency 30 years ago. Inexpensive thin-film methods have achieved laboratory efficiencies as high as 20 percent, still twice as high as most of the solar systems in deployment today. \u2026 Historically, the cost of PV modules (what we\u2019ve been using above) is about half the total installed cost of systems. The rest of the cost is installation. Fortunately, installation costs have also dropped at a similar pace to module costs. \u2026The cost of solar, in the average location in the U.S., will cross the current average retail electricity price of 12 cents per kilowatt hour in around 2020, or 9 years from now. In fact, given that retail electricity prices are currently rising by a few percent per year, prices will probably cross earlier, around 2018 for the country as a whole, and as early as 2015 for the sunniest parts of America. 10 years later, in 2030, solar electricity is likely to cost half what coal electricity does today. (more)This should be fantastic news for folks worried about carbon emissions or running out of oil. After all, projecting that a thirty year trend will continue for another ten years seems pretty safe. This isn\u2019t some mere speculation. Why don\u2019t we hear more about this?  Do people not like hearing good news about the future?","53":" On The Origin Of Pigeons  \u201cPigeons indeed,\u201d huffed Charles Darwin, his brow furrowed as he read to the end of a letter and laid it down on his desk.The letter contained feedback from his publisher John Murray on a draft of what would become On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. Murray had farmed out copies of the manuscript to a couple of his trusted advisers. One of them, a rural vicar and literary editor by the name of Whitwell Elwin, had not liked it all. \u201cAt every page, I was tantalized by the absence of the proofs,\u201d Elwin had written to Murray on 3 May 1859. In contrast to the Journal of Researches (later known as Voyage of the Beagle), which Elwin had found \u201cone of the most charming books\u201d, Darwin had written this new work in a \u201cmuch harder & drier style\u201d.Although opposed to the publication of what he saw as \u201ca wild and foolish piece of imagination\u201d, Elwin hadn\u2019t advised Murray to reject the manuscript outright. Instead, he had sought the advice of the geologist Charles Lyell. It was Lyell who said that the book should focus on Darwin\u2019s observations of pigeons \u201caccompanied with a brief statement of his general principles\u201d on natural selection. \u2026It is worth taking a moment to reflect on what might have been On the Origin of Pigeons. Such a volume would, Elwin had suggested, \u201cbe reviewed in every journal in the kingdom & would soon be on every table\u201d. He was probably right. Breeding \u2018fancy\u2019 pigeons was an extraordinarily popular pastime in Victorian Britain, with enthusiasts spanning the entire social spectrum, from the poorest weavers in London\u2019s Spitalfields to Queen Victoria herself.  But how effective would On the Origin of Pigeons have been as a vehicle for Darwin\u2019s ideas on evolution by natural selection?That is from Nature.  One of my best papers started out in my PhD Thesis as a general model of rational paternalism.  For publication the editor insisted that it appear as a model of paternalism in drug bans only, even though the math applied just as well to most other paternalism.I think the general rule is that little people should only have little ideas; big ideas are reserved for big people.  That makes little sense for an academia designed to achieve intellectual progress, but more sense for an academia designed to let people affiliate with credentialed impressiveness.","54":" Meaning of Meaning of Life  Rewatching Monty Python\u2019s Meaning of Life led me to wonder: what exactly do most people mean by \u201cthe meaning of life?\u201d Now first, it seems to me people mainly want to know the meaning of their life; they consider life in general mostly for hints on that. So consider some sample answers to \u201cwhat is the meaning of my life?\u201dGod has a plan for my life, so if I follow it my life has meaning.I am King George\u2019s personal assistant; my life is to serve him.I am the custodian of this forrest, and will protect and nurture it.My children are my life; all I want is for them to thrive.I am a native american, and fight to regain what has been taken from us.In the historical battle between tyrants and freedom-lovers, I fight for freedom.I do scientific research, to push back our frontiers of knowledge.I am a good musician and love music.It seems what people want is a satisfying story about their place in the universe. Since characters are the most important elements of a story, the main \u201cplace\u201d that matters to people is their social place \u2013 who they relate to and how. People feel they understand their place when they have a story saying how they can relate well to important social entities.Central to any social relation is whether the related person supports or opposes you in your conflicts. In fact, it seems enough to give your life meaning to just know who are your main natural allies and enemies among the important actors around, and what you can do to keep your allies supporting you, to give you high enough status.For example, if there is a great powerful God, it seems enough to know what he wants you to do to keep him on your side. If you are a lowly servant but have the King for an ally, little else matters but pleasing him. (Unless you had higher status ambitions.)  If you have committed yourself to certain strong relations, like a spouse or kids, then it may be enough to know how to keep them on your side. If your relations shift more often, you might instead focus on general features of your natural allies, such as gender, personality, ethnicity, or some grand shared far value. For example, knowing you are good at and love music may ensure the support of music lovers, \u201cyour people,\u201d wherever you go.People think their life has less meaning when enough aspects of it are determined by \u201cimpersonal\u201d forces that refuse to take social sides.  For example, a death caused by an enemy\u2019s plan, or an allies failure to help, or by the dead person\u2019s trying to help his allies, has far more meaning that a death caused by simple physics.","55":"1 AGI Is Sacred  Sacred things are especially valuable, sharply distinguished, and idealized as having less decay, messiness, inhomogeneities, or internal conflicts. We are not to mix the sacred (S) with the non-sacred (NS), nor to trade S for NS. Thus S should not have clear measures or money prices, and we shouldn\u2019t enforce rules that promote NS at S expense.We are to desire S \u201cfor itself\u201d, understand S intuitively not cognitively, and not choose S based on explicit calculation or analysis. We didn\u2019t make S; S made us. We are to trust \u201cpriests\u201d of S, give them more self-rule and job tenure, and their differences from us don\u2019t count as \u201cinequality\u201d. Objects, spaces, and times can become S by association. (More)When we treat something as sacred, we acquire the predictably extreme related expectations and values characteristic of our concept of \u201csacred\u201d. This biases us in the usual case where such extremes are unreasonable. (To min such biases, try math as sacred.)For example, most ancient societies had a great many gods, with widely varying abilities, features, and inclinations. And different societies had different gods. But while the ancients treated these gods as pretty sacred, Christians (and Jews) upped the ante. They \u201cknew\u201d from their God\u2019s recorded actions that he was pretty long-lasting, powerful, and benevolent. But they moved way beyond those \u201cfacts\u201d to draw more extreme, and thus more sacred, conclusions about their God.For example, Christians came to focus on a single uniquely perfect God: eternal, all-powerful, all-good, omnipresent, all-knowing (even re the future), all-wise, never-changing, without origin, self-sufficient, spirit-not-matter, never lies nor betrays trust, and perfectly loving, beautiful, gracious, kind, and pretty much any other good feature you can name. The direction, if not always the magnitude, of these changes is well predicted by our sacredness concept.It seems to me that we\u2019ve seen a similar process recently regarding artificial intelligence. I recall that, decades ago, the idea that we could make artificial devices who could do many of the kinds of tasks that humans do, even if not quite as well, was pretty sacred. It inspired much reverence, and respect for its priests. But just as Christians upped the ante regarding God, many recently have upped the AI ante, focusing on an even more sacred variation on AI, namely AGI: artificial general intelligence.The default AI scenario, the one that most straightforwardly projected past trends into the future, would go as follows. Many kinds of AI systems would specialize in many different tasks, each built and managed by different orgs. There\u2019d also be a great many AI systems of each type, controlled by competing organizations, of roughly comparable cost-effectiveness.Overall, the abilities of these AI would improve at roughly steady rates, with rate variations similar to what we\u2019ve seen over the last seventy years. Individual AI systems would be introduced, rise in influence for a time, and then decline in influence, as they rotted and become obsolete relative to rivals. AI systems wouldn\u2019t work equally well with all other systems, but would instead have varying degrees of compatibility and integration.The fraction of GDP paid for such systems would increase over time, and this would likely lead to econ growth rate increases, perhaps very large ones. Eventually many AI systems would reach human level on many tasks, but then continue to improve. Different kinds of system abilities would reach human level at different times. Even after this point, most all AI activity would be doing relatively narrow tasks.The upped-ante version of AI, namely AGI, instead changes this scenario in the direction of making it more sacred. Compared to AI, AGI is idealized, sharply distinguished from other AI, and associated with extreme values. For example:1) Few discussions of AGI distinguish different types of them. Instead, there is usually just one unspecialized type of AGI, assumed to be at least as good as humans at absolutely everything.2) AGI is not a name (like \u201ceconomy\u201d or \u201cnation\u201d) for a diverse collection of tools run by different orgs, tools which can all in principle be combined, but not always easily. An AGI is instead seen as a highly integrated system, fully and flexibly able to apply any subset its tools to any problem, without substantial barriers such as ownership conflicts, different representations, or incompatible standards.3) An AGI is usually seen as a consistent and coherent ideal decision agent. For example, its beliefs are assumed all consistent with each other, fully updated on all its available info, and its actions are all part of a single coherent long-term plan. Humans greatly deviate from this ideal.4) Unlike most human organizations, and many individual humans, AGIs are assumed to have no internal conflicts, where different parts work at cross purposes, struggling for control over the whole. Instead, AGIs can last forever maintaining completely reliable internal discipline.5) Today virtually all known large software systems rot. That is, as they are changed to add features and adapt to outside changes, they gradually become harder to usefully modify, and are eventually discarded and replaced by new systems built from scratch. But an AGI is assumed to suffer no such rot. It can instead remain effective forever.6) AGIs can change themselves internally without limit, and have sufficiently strong self-understanding to apply this ability usefully to all of their parts. This ability does not suffer from rot. Humans and human orgs are nothing like this.7) AGIs are usually assumed to have a strong and sharp separation between a core \u201cvalues\u201d module and all their other parts. It is assumed that value tendencies are not in any way encoded into the other many complex and opaque modules of an AGI system. The values module can be made frozen and unchanging at no cost to performance, even in the long run, and in this way an AGI\u2019s values can stay constant forever.8) AGIs are often assumed to be very skilled, even perfect, at cooperating with each other. Some say that is because they can show each other their read-only values modules. In this case, AGI value modules are assumed to be small, simple, and standardized enough to be read and understood by other AGIs.9) Many analyses assume there is only one AGI in existence, with all other humans and artificial systems at the time being vastly inferior. In fact this AGI is sometimes said to be more capable than the entire rest of the world put together. Some justify this by saying multiple AGIs cooperate so well as to be in effect a single AGI.10) AGIs are often assumed to have unlimited powers of persuasion. They can convince humans, other AIs, and organizations of pretty much any claim, even claims that would seem to be strongly contrary to their interests, and even if those entities are initially quite wary and skeptical of the AGI, and have AI advisors.11) AGIs are often assumed to have unlimited powers of deception. They could pretend to have one set of values but really have a completely different set of values, and completely fool the humans and orgs that developed them ever since they grew up from a \u201cbaby\u201d AI. Even when those had AI advisors. This super power of deception apparently applies only to humans and their organizations, but not to other AGIs.12) Many analyses assume a \u201cfoom\u201d scenario wherein this single AGI in existence evolves very quickly, suddenly, and with little warning out of far less advanced AIs who were evolving far more slowly. This evolution is so fast as to prevent the use of trial and error to find and fix its problematic aspects.13) The possible sudden appearance, in the not-near future, of such a unique powerful perfect creature, is seen by many as event containing overwhelming value leverage, for good or ill. To many, trying to influence this event is our most important and praise-worthy action, and its priests are the most important people to revere.I hope you can see how these AGI idealizations and values follow pretty naturally from our concept of the sacred. Just as that concept predicts the changes that religious folks seeking a more sacred God made to their God, it also predicts that AI fans seeking a more sacred AI would change it in these directions, toward this sort of version of AGI.I\u2019m rather skeptical that actual future AI systems, even distant future advanced ones, are well thought of as having this package of extreme idealized features. The default AI scenario I sketched above makes more sense to me.Added 7a: In the above I\u2019m listing assumptions commonly made about AGI in AI risk discussions, not applying a particular definition of AGI.","56":" Follow Your Passion, From A Distance  (Today my graduate research class begins; here is advice for new researchers.)\"Son, don\u2019t marry for money; hang around rich girls and marry for love.\" A joke I heard years ago from Chip Morningstar. Research topics work similarly.  Don\u2019t research a topic because it is popular; expose yourself to many popular topics and you will fall in love with a few.  Fall in love with a dozen topics; too few and you\u2019ll linger too long after they fail.  Consider:Fred, Ned, and Ted had never left their home town, but wanted careers as explorers.  They heard others had explored hills and caves nearby, but that seemed boring; they read of famous explorers going more interesting places.  So Fred, Ned, and Ted got out a map and chose their first places to explore: the deepest ocean, the longest cave, and the moon.   They were never heard from again.   To learn to explore, first follow the paths of previous explorers, first on a map, then from the air, then down on the ground.   Next, try going a mile off of one of those paths.  Then ten miles, then one hundred.   Similarly the best way to start researching is to take a good research paper and really understand it.  Then make a minor change, such as an assumption or data analysis technique.  Then make bigger changes. Another problem with passion is bias.  Especially in social science, people pick topics in order to convince the world of their one true answer.  But it is healthier to focus on questions, not answers.  By picking an answer before you\u2019ve really studied a topic, not only are you more likely to be wrong, but more important, you could miss interesting new angles.My colleague Bryan Caplan is the sharpest thinker I\u2019ve personally known.   He has a penetrating insight and willingness to embrace uncomfortable conclusions, except on a few topics, such as free will, dualism, and libertarian ethics, where he developed strong intuitions early.  Fortunately for Bryan, while these opinions may motivate his research, he had not directly worked in those areas.  Similarly, I have to admit it was good that I spent most of research time away from the topics I was the most passionate about.","57":" Open Thread  This is our monthly place to discuss appropriate topics that haven\u2019t appeared in recent posts.","58":" Further Than Africa  Imagine you asked people whether they cared about poor Africans, and if so, what were they doing to help.  Imagine your heard following answers:Africa is so far away, and some Africans are much richer than I am.  The process of sending money to such a distant place is so complex that I fear anything I gave would be stolen along they way, especially by rich Africans.  So I don\u2019t give.I contribute to the world economy just by doing my job and buying stuff.  Eventually that ends up helping everyone in the world, including Africans.I donate to my local hospital, volunteer at my local school library, and buy cookies from local girl scouts.  All charity helps the world, and so helps everyone in the world.I buy fair coffee to save the rain forrest, march to stop nukes, and drive a Prius to stop global warming.  When I save the world in these ways that helps Africans, who also live in this world.If I gave directly to Africans, that would cheat all the folks between here and Africa from the chance to help their neighbors.  My plan instead is to give to a local neighbor and have faith that this neighbor will then give to his neighbor, and so on until far away Africans are helped.Which of these folks would you conclude really did care about Africans? What if you offered to match their donated funds by a factor of a million or trillion, and they still fell back on these excuses? Would you still think they cared?A few weeks ago at Oxford I talked on \u201cWe Don\u2019t Donate To The Distant Future; Do We Care?\u201d (slides here).  I pointed out that no one tries, like Ben Franklin, to use compound interest to donate huge sums to the distant future, at a tiny cost to themselves.  When I suggested that this fact suggests few care much about the distant future, people responded with arguments like the above.  They donate to charity, try to save the world, do their job that builds the world economy, they fear donations would be stolen and many future folks will be rich, and its better to just give to their kids with faith that each generation will give to the next.  So of course they care about the future \u2013 how dare I suggest otherwise?","59":" Medicare Train Wreck  A few weeks ago I said:Medical expenses now eat 16% of U.S. G.D.P.  That percentage has doubled every thirty years; it was 8% thirty years ago, and 4% thirty years before that.   It will probably double again, to 32%, in the next thirty years. For many years policy makers have warned of an upcoming \"Medicare Train Wreck,\" when rising medical costs collide with a surge of retiring baby boomers.  Wednesday\u2019s Wall Street Journal reminds us again:A recently released report by the program\u2019s trustees found that within seven years Medicare taxes will fall short of Medicare expenses by more than 45%. \u2026 Until a few years ago, Social Security and Medicare were taking in more than they spent, on the whole. Thus they provided revenue for other federal programs. That situation is now reversed, and last year the combined deficits in the two programs claimed 5.3% of federal income tax revenues.  In 15 years these two programs will require more than a fourth of income tax revenues: \u2026 By 2030, \u2026 these two programs will require almost one out of every two federal income tax dollars.If the world stays relatively boring, this will be the biggest US politics issue over the next twenty years.  The key questions:Who will pay: raise taxes, limit treatments covered, tax docs, or cut off the richer & younger?Who will be blamed: docs, the old, the young, the rich, the poor, Republicans, Democrats, corporations, immigrants, foreigners?Added:  Income tax is only half of federal taxes, but most of Medicaid, which is about as big as Medicare, also goes to the elderly.","60":" Piling On Avatar  Piling On AvatarLike most movies, Avatar makes less sense the more you think about it.  I recall others complaining about (and myself noticing) its shallow characters, wooden dialog, overly forced conflict, and its all too obvious message.

All of these appeared in humans only a few millennia ago.  Our meeting them at such a similar stage of development is an incredible time coincidence.Animals on this planet evolved hardware for direct mind contact and control, though this serves no apparent function other than enabling natives to domesticate animals.  Yet a few millennia is far too short a time for such hardware to evolve.Huge animals live near natives eager to hunt them to gain their meat at a proportionally low cost.  Such animals will be quickly exterminated, as humans did to most huge Earth animals.  An even more incredible coincidence to arrive before then.A complex global system for exchanging signals between trees, natives, and animals has arisen, though it seems to perform no evolutionary function except in the extreme circumstance of alien invaders of the planet.In three months a human working an avatar body can outperform every local who has learned their bodies for decades.Like most movies, Avatar makes less sense the more you think about it.

Yet a few millennia is far too short a time for such detailed matched hardware to evolve.Huge animals live near natives, who should be eager to hunt them to gain their meat at a proportionally low cost. Such animals will be quickly exterminated, as humans did to most huge Earth animals.  It is an even greater time coincidence to arrive while such animals remain common.A complex global system for exchanging signals between trees, natives, and animals has arisen, though it seems to perform no function except in the extreme circumstance of being warned of an alien invasion by advanced natives.  How could unused abilities of a single undying organism ever evolve?In three months a human working an avatar body can outperform every native who has learned their bodies for decades.","61":" Pod People Paternalism  The fourth film adaptation of Jack Finney\u2019s 1955 novel Invasion of the Body Snatchers, this time with Nicole Kidman, is now out on dvd.  It doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone\u2019s favorite, but it does re-raise an interesting thought experiment in paternalism.  After all, in this movie \"pod people\" retain their memories and their new \"culture\" makes them happy, serene, cooperative, and peaceful.  Their main crimes are:a flatter emotional tone,a foreign origin, andconverting others by forceBut similar complaints apply to giving kids Ritalin, pushing upper class culture in the inner city, or pushing western culture in the third world.  Now hard-line libertarians can consistently oppose using government power to purse such policies, even if they really benefit people.  But what about the rest of you?  Are happy people with the emotional range, peace, and productivity of a typical engineer really such a horror?  From the view of non-libertarian pod people, doesn\u2019t it make sense to force everyone else to convert?","62":" Elevator Myths  In most elevators, at least in any built or installed since the early nineties, the door-close button doesn\u2019t work.

This functions well to test individual impressiveness. Today, academic and mass media conversations today follow similar norms, though they did this much less in the ancient world.While ancient artists and musicians tried to perfect common styles, modern artists and musicians seek more distinctive personal styles. For example, while songs were once designed to sound good when ordinary folks sang them, now songs are designed to create a unique impressive performance by one artist.Politicians often go out of their way to do \u201cposition taking\u201d on many issues, even on issues they have little chance of influencing policy while in office. Voters prefer systems like proportional representation where voters can identify more closely with particular representatives, even if this doesn\u2019t give voters better outcomes overall. Knowing many of a politician\u2019s positions helps voters to identify with them.\u201cSophomoric\u201d thinkers, typically college sophomores, are eager to take positions on as many common topics as possible, even if this means taking poorly consider positions. They don\u2019t feel they are adult until they have an opinion ready for most common intellectual conversations. This is more feasible when opinions on each topic area are reduced to choices between a small number of standard \u201cisms\u201d, offering integrated packages of answers. Sophomoric thinkers love isms.We often try to extract \u201cisms\u201d out of individuals, such as my colleagues Tyler Cowen or Bryan Caplan. We might ask \u201cWhat is the Caplanian position on X?\u201d That is, we wonder how they would answer random questions, presuming that we can infer a coherent style from past positions that would answer all future questions, at least within some wide scope. Intellectuals who desire wider attention often go out of their way to express opinions on many topics, chosen via a distinctive personal style.We pretend that we search only for truth, picking each specific position only via the strongest specific evidence and arguments. And in many mundane contexts that\u2019s not a bad approximation. But in many other grander contexts we seek more to become and associate with distinctive intellectual artists. Such artists are impressive both via the wide range of topics on which they can be impressive, and via having a distinctive personal style that they can bring to bear on this range of topics.This all makes complete sense as an impressiveness contest, but far less sense as a way for the world to jointly estimate accurate Bayesian estimates on each topic. I\u2019m sure you can make up reasons why distinctive intellectual styles that imply positions on wide ranges of topics are really great ways to produce accuracy. But they will mostly sound like excuses to me.Sophomoric thinkers often retain for a lifetime the random opinions they quickly generate without much thought. Yet they don\u2019t want to just inherit their parents positions; they need to generate their own new opinions. I wonder which effect will dominate when young ems choose opinions; will they tend to adopt standard positions of prior clan members, or generate their own new individual opinions?","64":" Not Paleolithic Mating  In February I quoted Charlotte Allen quoting Geoffrey Miller on New Paleolithic Mating:Some relationships might have lasted no more than a few days. \u2026 Many Pleistocene mothers probably had boyfriends. But each woman\u2019s boyfriend may not have been the father of any of her offspring. \u2026 Males may have given some food to females and their offspring, and may have defended them from other men, but \u2026 more as courtship effort than paternal investment.That\u2019s a pretty fair description of mating life today in the urban underclass and the meth-lab culture of rural America. Take away the offspring, blocked by the Pill and ready abortion, and it\u2019s also a pretty fair description of today\u2019s prolonged singles scene.Lately I\u2019ve been filling a big hole in my social science education, by reading lots of anthropology of nomadic forager bands, our main fossil evidence on our distant ancestors\u2019 lives.  I\u2019ve learned modern mating is far from Paleolithic!  Consider:It is unusual, but not exceptional, for a lone woman to spend the day gathering. In the times I observed at the Duda camps, the solitary foragers were either postmenopausal women or young, unmarried women who were still without children. Women with children or adolescent, unmarried girls usually gather bush food in the company of two or more other women. The !Kung themselves claim that lovers (as well as married couples) sometimes arrange to meet privately in the bush. !Kung sleeping arrangements may promote these tactics, for at night whole families sleep outdoors together gathered around individual campfires and within a few feet of other families sleeping at their own fires. \u2026In the bush [in contrast to villages,] concerned relatives will work to keep a young couple together up to a certain  point, but if the individuals themselves feel mis-matched, there are few, if any, arguments that will persuade them to stay together.  When (as often happens) the young couple divorces, no one loses a great deal \u2013 no property of any economic weight has changed hands, etc. \u2026 Such a marriage in the bush setting would have had a different history.  !Uku would have left her husband long before, in all likelihood to spend another year or two in casual flirtations before marrying again.In one evening, a modern city woman can see and choose among more men her age than a forager woman would meet people in her lifetime.  If a modern woman prefers, all those men can be strangers, so that if she goes home with one there is little risk of word getting back to anyone she knows.  The next night she can choose among an entirely different group just as big.In contrast, a typical forager woman only has frequent contact with the 30-50 people in her band, with a handful of men near her age.  Most of the men she might find attractive already have a woman.  Foragers bands meet periodically with a few known associate bands, and a young woman typically switches from her parent\u2019s band, usually to be with a particular man.The band lives in very close quarters, with everyone watching everyone\u2019s faces closely.  Illicit flirtation must be very subtle.  People know who goes off alone, and quickly draw conclusions about who might meet whom out there; happily mated folks are expected not to go off alone.Yes foragers switch mates during their lives, but men often react to betrayal with violence, and women aren\u2019t above spreading malicious gossip about rivals.  Babies of single forager moms face a greater risk of harm.  For our distant ancestors, switching and cheating were far harder, and the options far more limited.  Modern dating is really quite unlike that of our ancestors.Added: Thursday adds \u201cthree most important factors driving modern mating:  1. Urban anonymity  2. Reliable birth control 3. A woman\u2019s ability to support herself.\u201d","65":" Two Recent Talks  On April 27, I talked at Harvard Business School on information accounting: audio, slides.On May 5, I talked in Geneva on the economics of artificial intelligence: audio, slides.","66":" How To Survey Confidence  In a 3-point elicitation procedure, an expert is asked for a lower limit, upper limit, and best guess, the two limits creating an interval of some assigned confidence level (e.g., 80%).

Unfortunately it primarily speaks for their lacking knowledge of physics.Among physicists, the simulation hypothesis is not popular and that\u2019s for a good reason \u2013 we know that it is difficult to find consistent explanations for our observations. After all, finding consistent explanations is what we get paid to do.Proclaiming that \u201cthe programmer did it\u201d doesn\u2019t only not explain anything \u2013 it teleports us back to the age of mythology. The simulation hypothesis annoys me because it intrudes on the terrain of physicists. It\u2019s a bold claim about the laws of nature that however doesn\u2019t pay any attention to what we know about the laws of nature. If you try to build the universe from classical bits, you won\u2019t get quantum effects, so forget about this \u2013 it doesn\u2019t work. ..For the purpose of this present post, the details don\u2019t actually matter all that much. What\u2019s more important is that these difficulties of getting the physics right are rarely even mentioned when it comes to the simulation hypothesis. Instead there\u2019s some fog about how the programmer could prevent simulated brains from ever noticing contradictions, for example contradictions between discretization and special relativity.But how does the programmer notice a simulated mind is about to notice contradictions and how does he or she manage to quickly fix the problem? If the programmer could predict in advance what the brain will investigate next, it would be pointless to run the simulation to begin with. So how does he or she know what are the consistent data to feed the artificial brain with when it decides to probe a specific hypothesis? Where does the data come from? The programmer could presumably get consistent data from their own environment, but then the brain wouldn\u2019t live in a simulation. (more)Video games today typically only compute visual and auditory details of scenes that players are currently viewing, and then only to a resolution players are capable of noticing. The physics, chemistry, etc. is also made only as consistent and exact as typical players will notice. And most players don\u2019t notice enough to bother them.What if it were physicists playing a video game? What if they recorded a long video game period from several points of view, and were then able go back and spend years scouring their data carefully? Mightn\u2019t they then be able to prove deviations? Of course, if they tried long and hard enough. And all the more so if the game allowed players to construct many complex measuring devices.But if the physicists were entirely within a simulation, then all the measuring, recording, and computing devices available to those physicists would be under full control of the simulators. If devices gave measurements showing deviations, the output of those devices could just be directly changed. Or recordings of previous measurements could be changed. Or simulators could change the high level output of computer calculations that study measurements. Or they might perhaps more directly change what the physicists see, remember, or think.In addition, within a few decades computers in our world will typically use reversible computation (as I discuss in my book), wherein costs are low to reverse previous computations. When simulations are run on reversible computers, it becomes feasible and even cheap to wait until a simulation reveals some problem, and then reverse the simulation back to a earlier point, make some changes, and run the simulation forward again to see it the problem is avoided. And repeat until the problem is in fact avoided.So those running a simulation containing physicists who could detect deviations from some purported physics of the simulated world could actually wait until some simulated physicist claimed to have detected a deviation. Or even wait until an article based on their claim was accepted for peer review. And then back up the simulation and add more physics detail to try to avoid the problem.Yes, to implement a strategy like this those running the simulation might have to understand the physics issues as well as did the physicists in the simulation. And they\u2019d have to adjust the cost of computing their simulation to the types of tests that physicists inside examined. In the worse case, if the simulated universe seemed to allow for very large incompressible computations, then if the simulators couldn\u2019t find a way to fudge that by changing high level outputs, they might have to find an excuse to kill off the physicists, to directly change their thoughts, or to end the simulation.But overall it seems to me that those running a simulation containing physicists have many good options short of ending the simulation. Sabine Hossenfelder goes on to say:It\u2019s not that I believe it\u2019s impossible to simulate a conscious mind with human-built \u2018artificial\u2019 networks \u2013 I don\u2019t see why this should not be possible. I think, however, it is much harder than many future-optimists would like us to believe. Whatever the artificial brains will be made of, they won\u2019t be any easier to copy and reproduce than human brains. They\u2019ll be one-of-a-kind. They\u2019ll be individuals.It therefore seems implausible to me that we will soon be outnumbered by artificial intelligences with cognitive skills exceeding ours. More likely, we will see a future in which rich nations can afford raising one or two artificial consciousnesses and then consult them on questions of importance.Here I just don\u2019t see what Sabine can be thinking. Today we can quickly make many copies of most any item that we can make in factories from concise designs. Yes, quantum states have a \u201cno-cloning theorem\u201d, but even so if we knew of a good quantum state to start a system in, we should be able to create many such systems that start in that same state. And I know of no serious claim that human minds make important use of unclonable quantum states, or that this would prevent creating many such systems fast.Yes, biological systems today can be hard to copy fast, because they are so crammed with intricate detail. But as with other organs like bones, hearts, ears, eyes, and skin, most of the complexity in biological brain cells probably isn\u2019t used directly for the function that those cells provide the rest of the body, in this case signal processing. So just as emulations of bones, hearts, ears, eyes, and skin can be much simpler than those organs, a brain emulation should be much simpler than a brain.Maybe Sabine will explain her reasoning here.","68":" Old Minds Are Fragile  Consider three design problems:Case #1: First, you are asked to modify a stock car, making it into a truck to haul stuff. After you do that, you are asked to create a race car. Which would you rather start from for this second task, another stock car, or the stock car that you turned into a truck?Case #2: A species of beetle lives in a varied and changing environment, and so has a rather simple and basic design. Some of these beetles invade a different and more stable environment, and acquire adaptations specific to that environment. A third rather different but also stable environment opens up adjacent to both previous environments. Which beetle type\u2019s descendants will likely fill this third environment?Case #3: Over the last decade a group wrote software to do a certain task (e.g., print driver, web server, spreadsheet, etc.) This design of this software was matched to certain features of the problem environment, such as hardware, network speeds, etc. Today there is a need for software to do a similar task, except that the problem environment has changed. To write this new software, would you have your team modify this previous software, or start a new system mostly from scratch?In all these cases, one makes a system to function in a given environment, and can either modify a complex system adapted to a different environment, or \u201cstart over\u201d via modifying a simpler system less adapted to any specific environment. In general, the more different is the new environment from the old, the better it is to start over. Old  systems tend to be rigid, which makes them fragile, in that they break if you bend them too far.This suggests that designed systems tend to get irreversibly fragile as they adapt to specific environments. When context changes greatly, it is usually easier to build new systems from \u201cscratch,\u201d than to un-adapt systems designed for other contexts. Software tends to \u201crot\u201c, for example.An empirical prediction here is that species occupying highly variable environments tend to have more descendant species in other environments, compared to species occupying less variable environments. I don\u2019t know if this has been tested. It fits with the Innovator\u2019s Dilemma though, where firms who serve the low end of a product line with simpler techs tend to creep up and displace those serving the high end; high end products tend to be more complex.Today I\u2019m focused on this being bad news for the feasibility of immortality, at least for human-like creatures. You see, our minds seem designed to adapt to the environment in which we grow up, via youthful plasticity transitioning to elderly rigidity. For example, we are great at learning languages when young, and terrible when old. We are similarly receptive when young to new ways to categorize and conceive of things, but once we have often used particular ways, we find it harder to understand and use alternatives.The brains of most animals peak in functionality during their key reproductive years, and do worse both before and after. Short lived animals peak sooner than long lived animals. Some of the early rise is due to learning, and some of later decline is due to the decline of individual cells and connections. Some of this pattern may even be due to an explicit plan to turn up some dials on plasticity early on, and then turn down those dials later. But I think another important part of this rise and fall is due to a general robust tendency for adapted systems to slide from plasticity to rigidity.Thus even if we succeed in creating emulations of whole human brains, \u201cems\u201d which can use backups, body swaps, etc. to avoid bodily death and decay, we should expect such ems to decay by getting mentally rigid with subjective age. Even if we do not emulate any decline in individual cell and connection performance, nor any age-specific general plasticity dial settings, the mind itself may well decay with subjective experience, because such decay is just intrinsic to mind design.Now in software design one can often slow a slide to rigidity by refactoring code, such as by looking for better abstractions to achieve modularity. But the brain probably already has some analogues to refractoring, such as in its ways to reorganize concepts. And even with large refactoring efforts, most designed software eventually gets rigid, so that when environments change enough such software is replaced wholesale by new systems built from scratch.Similarly, em workers who start out subjectively young, and then learn how to work in a stable environment, may become increasingly productive in that environment, even after thousands of years of subjective experience. But when a new quite different work environment appears, one can probably gain more work productivity by training subjectively young ems for it, rather than trying to change ems who had spend thousands of subjective years adapting to a very different environment.Today most houses and cars are in principle immortal, in the sense that enough maintenance can keep them functioning indefinitely. Yet most houses and cars are not immortal in practice, because those maintenance costs keep rising to the point where it is cheaper to build new houses and cars. Similarly it might be possible to keep very old ems around, even when they have become much less productive because relevant environments have changed. Someone, however, would have to pay that cost, relative to the option of using more productive younger ems. And as with houses and cars today, maybe few will pay.If you personally hope to become an em with an especially long productive subjective life, it is probably important to stay general and flexible for as long as you can. Prefer to acquire habits and insights that are widely applicable, and whose value is likely to long continue. Prefer to write, deal with people, and manage complexity, rather than learning the detailed layout of a city or how best to write in a particular new programming language.Eventually we may find mind designs with a much weaker tendency toward rigidity with age. And we may find ways to transfer some important elements of once-human minds, such as their memory and personality, into this alternative framework. But even then there should be some aging. And it gets even less clear if you\u2019d want to think of such a changed creature as you.Even more eventually, the universe should get a lot more stable, and with it the environments where minds function. Then there will be a lot more scope for very long lived human-like minds. If there are any human-like minds left at that point.Added: Stem cells fit this; bodies usually make cells designed for specific places from general simpler stem cells, not by changing other specific cells.","69":" Firms Are Under-Trusted  Tyler\u2019s new book Big Business is out next week. I haven\u2019t read it \u2013 won\u2019t get access until you do. But in an excerpt he just posted from his final chapter, Tyler considers a big question I\u2019ve pondered before:Think[ing] of corporations as people \u2026 is probably also necessary for social cohesion. \u2026 Otherwise politics might treat business too harshly. \u2026 Consumer loyalty to corporations, even if irrational, is part of what induces better behavior from those corporations. \u2026 positive business incentive, one that would not be present if all consumers were more aware of the somewhat more cynical truth: that corporations should be judged not as friends but as abstract, shark-like legal entities devoted to commercial profit. The more that consumers see the relationship as possibly long-term, the more loyally profit-seeking corporations will end up behaving in a long-term and socially responsible manner. Societies need their illusions in this regard, and thus it can be dangerous to fully articulate and make publicly known the entire truth about business corporations and the fundamentally dubious nature of their loyalty.So the trick is this: the public needs to some extent to believe in corporations as people, just to keep the system running. Workers need to hold similar feelings, to maintain workplace cohesion. Yet when it comes to politics and public policy, we need to distance ourselves from such emotional and anthropomorphized attitudes. We need to stop being loyal to corporations for the sake of loyalty and friendship, and we also need to stop being disappointed in corporations all the time, as if we should be judging them by the standards we apply to individual human beings and particularly our friends. \u2026One reason we like to think of corporations as our friends is that we can feel in greater control that way. I\u2019ve already discussed just how much we rely on corporations \u2026 you can choose what to buy in the Giant, Safeway, or Whole Foods, but it\u2019s hard to step outside the commercial network as a whole, \u2026 people carry around a mental picture of being surrounded by people they can trust, if only salespeople. \u2026 it is emotionally very hard for people to internalize emotionally the true and correct picture of those businesses as partaking in an impersonal order based on mostly selfish, profit-seeking behavior. (more)I\u2019m just not seeing the problem that Tyler sees. We humans do not simply trust everyone; we are quite aware that the interests of others may not align with ours, and that they may betray our trust. We are suspicious of each other, and in fact we are built to be as selfish as we can get away with; when we are trusting and trustworthy it is because our evolved instincts estimate that to be in our interest.We sometimes misjudge who to trust how much, but such errors do not at all tend to favor for-profit firms. Our egalitarian forager instincts make us especially distrusting of powerful humans and large organizations, especially when it seems logically possible that they may profit by hurting us. Our evolved instincts don\u2019t seem to sufficiently appreciate how competition disciplines for-profit firms today, probably because competition was a less effective force for our distant ancestors.Compared to ordinary humans that we distrust to a similar degree, for-profit firms actually tend to be much more well-behaved and helpful. So I don\u2019t see us as under an illusion here.In the above Tyler sounds a lot like what I often hear from AI risk people, who worry that we will trust AIs as if human, and be cut down by AI alien indifference to our plight. I hear similar fears from an overlapping group that fears selfish capitalist firms will eventually destroy us all. I\u2019m much less worried than they.","70":" \u201cKnowing\u201d Too Much  Page 1,617 of the 2,400-page law signed by President Barack Obama \u2026 creates an institute, funded with $500 million or more annually, to spur studies of which drugs, devices and medical procedures work best. \u2026 The health bill\u2019s funding builds upon $1.1 billion approved by Congress last year for effectiveness research. The new legislation creates a nonprofit Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute \u2026 run by a 19-member board of governors with three representatives of drug, device and diagnostic-testing companies as well as patient advocates, doctors and the National Institutes of Health. \u2026 Its funding will start at $10 million this year and reach about $500 million in 2013.More here.  10% of this annual budget would pay the cost of an updated RAND health insurance experiment; will they do it?!  Alas, probably not; they\u2019ll probably say that would cost too much to confirm what they already \u201cknow,\u201d medicine\u2019s fantastic value.  Megan McArdle has been similarly failing to get Obamacare proponents to make clear predictions about what they previously suggested were its huge health benefits.  Austin Frakt illustrates a further mental block:The gold standard of the randomized experiment is not without deficiencies. Such experiments are \u201ctime consuming, expensive, and may not always be practical.\u201d \u2026 They are also not always decisive. Even the RAND health insurance experiment (HIE) has been critiqued (and defended). That is not to suggest that it is certainly flawed (or certainly perfect), it is merely to say that variations in interpretation exist for results of randomized experiments just as they do for non-experimental studies.Indeed, Angrist and Pischke (and I) agree with Leamer that \u201crandomized experiments differ only in degree from nonexperimental evaluations of causal effects.\u201d The authors add that \u201ca well-done observational study can be more credible and persuasive than a poorly executed randomized trial.\u201d It is for this and the other foregoing features of randomized experiments that I believe the half-billion dollars or so that some advocate spending on another RAND HIE would arguably be better spent funding well-conceived observational or natural experiment-based studies. (A half-billion dollars could found on the order of 1,000 observational studies.)The main complaints today about the RAND experiment are that it was done too long ago and contained too few people over too short a time.  The outcome of the experiment was very clear on its initially defined health measure: those with more medicine were not significantly healthier.  The main disputes arise from folks not liking that result, and offering other outcome measures after the fact.  The more time passes, the more folks feel free to dismiss the RAND experiment as hopelessly out of date.No doubt a thousand \u201cwell-conceived\u201d observational studies, neutrally executed and interpreted, could in principle give more total info than one big experiment.  But since a great many funders, researchers, publishers, and meta-analysts seem much more willing to accept pro than anti-medicine results, then having a thousand varied studies would give many thousands of opportunities for such biases to skew their results.Given the scope for biases, funding a thousand observational studies simply cannot give a clear decisive answer.  The main hope for such clarity is from just a few big experiments focused clear health outcomes agreed on ahead of time.  This is feasible, and would cost only a tiny fraction of the two trillion a year we spend on medicine, but alas probably won\u2019t happen, because people \u201cknow\u201d too much.","71":" Manipulators as Mirrors  Mirror, mirror, on the wall \u2026  Do you want to see yourself as you really are, instead of as you wish you were?

And if parents have the sort of values that kids could deeply betray, then it does make sense for parents to watch out for such betrayal, ready to go to extremes like disowning in response.But surely parents who feel inclined to disown their kids should be encouraged to study their kids carefully before making such a choice. For example, parents considering whether to disown their child for refusing to fight a war for their nation, or for working for a cigarette manufacturer, should wonder to what extend national patriotism or anti-smoking really are core values, as opposed to being mere revisable opinions they collected at one point in support of other more-core values. Such parents would be wise to study the lives and opinions of their children in some detail before choosing to disown them.I\u2019d like people to think similarly about my attempts to analyze likely futures. The lives of our descendants in the next great era after this our industry era may be as different from ours\u2019 as ours\u2019 are from farmers\u2019, or farmers\u2019 are from foragers\u2019. When they have lived as neighbors, foragers have often strongly criticized farmer culture, as farmers have often strongly criticized industry culture. Surely many have been tempted to disown any descendants who adopted such despised new ways. And while such disowning might hold them true to core values, if asked we would advise them to consider the lives and views of such descendants carefully, in some detail, before choosing to disown.Similarly, many who live industry era lives and share industry era values, may be disturbed to see forecasts of descendants with life styles that appear to reject many values they hold dear. Such people may be tempted to reject such outcomes, and to fight to prevent them, perhaps preferring a continuation of our industry era to the arrival of such a very different era, even if that era would contain far more creatures who consider their lives worth living, and be far better able to prevent the extinction of Earth civilization. And such people may be correct that such a rejection and battle holds them true to their core values.But I advise such people to first try hard to see this new era in some detail from the point of view of its typical residents. See what they enjoy and what fills them with pride, and listen to their criticisms of your era and values. I hope that my future analysis can assist such soul-searching examination. If after studying such detail, you still feel compelled to disown your likely descendants, I cannot confidently say you are wrong. My job, first and foremost, is to help you see them clearly.","73":" Friendly Projects vs. Products  I\u2019m a big board game fan, and my favorite these days is Imperial.   Imperial looks superficially like the classic strategy-intense war game Diplomacy, but with a crucial difference:  instead of playing a nation trying to win WWI, you play a banker trying to make money from that situation.  If a nation you control (by having loaned it the most) is threatened by another nation, you might indeed fight a war, but you might instead just buy control of that nation.  This is a great way to mute conflicts in a modern economy: have conflicting groups buy shares in each other.For projects to create new creatures, such as ems or AIs, there are two distinct friendliness issues: Project Friendliness  Will the race make winners and losers, and how will winners treat losers? While any race might be treated as part of a total war on several sides, usually the inequality created by the race is moderate and tolerable.  For larger inequalities, projects can explicitly join together, agree to cooperate in weaker ways such as by sharing information, or they can buy shares in each other.  Naturally arising info leaks and shared standards may also reduce inequality even without intentional cooperation.  The main reason for failure here would seem to be the sorts of distrust that plague all human cooperation.Product Friendliness  Will the creatures cooperate with or rebel against their creators?  Folks running a project have reasonably strong incentives to avoid this problem.  Of course for the case of extremely destructive creatures the project might internalize more of the gains from cooperative creatures than they do the losses from rebellious creatures.  So there might be some grounds for wider regulation.  But the main reason for failure here would seem to be poor judgment, thinking you had your creatures more surely under control than in fact you did. It hasn\u2019t been that clear to me which of these is the main concern re \"friendly AI.\" Added:  Since Eliezer says product friendliness is his main concern, let me note that the main problem there is the tails of the distribution of bias among project leaders.  If all projects agreed the problem was very serious they would take near appropriate caution to isolate their creatures, test creature values, and slow creature development enough to track progress sufficiently.  Designing and advertising a solution is one approach to reducing this bias, but it need not need the best approach; perhaps institutions like prediction markets that aggregate info and congeal a believable consensus would be more effective.","74":" Where You Stand Versus Sit  While this blog is called \u201cOvercoming Bias\u201d, I don\u2019t recall explicitly addressing biases in a while. So let me revisit a bias which, though it is pretty clearly visible, most people don\u2019t even bother to hide: where they stand depends on where they sit.For example, their position on feminism and gender relations is predictable from their gender. Their position on redistribution is predictable from their generation. Their position on math vs words is predictable from their math vs word ability. Their position on a dispute between marketing and engineering depends on which division they sit in. And so on. If you give it some thought, you will notice that a lot of views are predictable, at least on average, from where people sit.Yes, this is less of a problem for views on what is good for people like them, or what things look like to people like them. But most of us have a great many views on what is good in general, and what things are in general, views that are also predictable from who we are.Yes, most of us can quickly point out exceptions, where our views go against that predicted by where we sit. But this is less about particular views and more about an overall pattern. (And it would be great if someone would set up a poll to show people just how well their views are predicted by where they sit.)Yes, you choose some of where you sit. So you might claim that correlations between where you stand and sit are caused by your first choosing your view, and then choosing your place in the world. But this only works for a small number of views per place, as only a small number can plausibly have had strong influence on this choice. Thus such correlations become more or a problem the more different unrelated views are implied by your place.We tend to be more tolerant of partisan views by experts and elites. That is, when experts disagree with non experts, or elites disagree with non-elites, we tend to take the side of the experts and elites. And thus are more okay with self-favoring views of experts and elites. But only because we are even less okay with those who disagree with experts and elite; be especially wary of your views being predictable by those features.One reason we tend to tolerate this bias in ourselves is that we don\u2019t mind showing allegiance to our associates, who tend to reward such loyalty. But ask yourself how biased you really want to be in favoring your associates.This bias seems to me so pervasive that someone who had successfully rid themselves of it would likely also have rid themselves of a great many other biases. So this one seems well worth working on for that reason alone.Added 1Jan: A Twitter poll asking people for their rank re this bias finds a pretty well-calibrated distribution. Thus people tend to accept and embrace this bias; they aren\u2019t embarrassed enough by it to try to deny it.","75":" Toward Reality TV MBAs  The quality of firm managers matters enormously for firm productivity. How can we get better managers? We already select the best people in terms of simple features like intelligence, conscientiousness, etc. But apparently there is still huge variation in quality, even after controlling for such things. Typical MBA programs teach people some business basics, but don\u2019t seem to help much; they mainly serve to select elites and connect them to each other.I recently had dinner with a few San Francisco tech startup CEOs, who were worth high sums. They weren\u2019t obviously that much smarter etc. than others. Their high value came from having actually navigated difficult business waters, successfully enough. That sort of experience and track record is gold. Some said that business success came from making the right decision at a half dozen key points; any wrong move would have killed them.Some had first gained experience via being a personal assistant to someone else in such a role. Such an assistant goes to all meetings and sees pretty much everything that manager does, over a several year period. Apparently children learn similar things via parents dinner conversations:The majority of male entrepreneurs in Norway start a firm in an industry closely related to the one in which their father is employed. These entrepreneurs outperform others in the same industry. \u2026 \u2018Dinner table human capital\u2019 \u2013 that is, industry knowledge learned through their parents \u2013 is an important factor.\u2026 the effect of parents helping out, although possibly quite important, is smaller. (more; HT Alex T)If one can learn much from just watching the inside story of real firms over several years, that suggests a big win: record the full lives of many rising managers over several years, and show a mildly compressed and annotated selection of such recordings to aspiring managers. Such recordings could be compressed by deleting sleep and non-social periods. They could be annotated to identify key decisions and ask viewers to make their own choices, before they see actual choices. Recordings might be selected 2\/3 from the most successful, and 1\/3 from a sampling of others.Yes, there are issues of privacy and business secrets. But these are already issues for personal assistants and others who attend key business meetings. Waiting five years could take away many business secret concerns. And we don\u2019t have to make these videos available to the world; making manager experiences visible to only 100 times more people might increase our pool of good manager candidates by a factor of 100. And that could be worth trillions to the world economy.","76":" Social Science Critics  Many critics of Age of Em are critics of social science; they suggest that even though we might be able to use today\u2019s physics or computer science to guess at futures, social science is far less useful.For example At Crooked Timber Henry Farrell was \u201ca lot more skeptical that social science can help you make predictions\u201d, though he was more skeptical about thinking in terms of markets than in terms of \u201cvast and distributed hierarchies of exploitation\u201d, as these \u201cgenerate complexities\u201d instead of \u201c breaking them down.\u201dAt Science Fact & Science Fiction Concatenation, Jonathan Cowie suggests social science only applies to biological creatures:While Hanson\u2019s treatise is engaging and interesting, I confess that personally I simply do not buy into it. Not only have I read too much SF to think that em life will be as prescriptive as Hanson portrays, but coming from the biological sciences, I am acutely aware of the frailties of the human brain hence mind (on a psychobiological basis). Furthermore, I am uncomfortable in the way that the social science works Hanson draws upon to support his em conclusions: it is an apples and oranges thing, I do not think that they can readily translate from one to the other; from real life sociobiological constructs to, in effect, machine code. There is much we simply do not know about this, as yet, untrodden land glimpsed from afar.At Ricochet, John Walker suggests we can\u2019t do social science if we don\u2019t know detail stories of specific lives:The book is simultaneously breathtaking and tedious. The author tries to work out every aspect of em society: the structure of cities, economics, law, social structure, love, trust, governance, religion, customs, and more. Much of this strikes me as highly speculative, especially since we don\u2019t know anything about the actual experience of living as an em or how we will make the transition from our present society to one dominated by ems.At his blog, Lance Fortnow suggests my social science assumes too much rationality:I don\u2019t agree with all of Hanson\u2019s conclusions, in particular he expects a certain rationality from ems that we don\u2019t often see in humans, and if ems are just human emulations, they may not want a short life and long retirement. Perhaps this book isn\u2019t about ems and robots at all, but about Hanson\u2019s vision of human-like creatures as true economic beings as he espouses in his blog. Not sure it is a world I\u2019d like to be a part of, but it\u2019s a fascinating world nevertheless.At Entropy Chat List, Rafal Smigrodzki suggests social science doesn\u2019t apply if ems adjust their brain design:My second major objection: Your pervasive assumption that em will remain largely static in their overall structure and function. I think this assumption is at least as unlikely as the em-before-AI assumption. Imagine .. you have the detailed knowledge of your own mind, the tools to modify it, and the ability to generate millions of copies to try out various modifications. .. you do analyze this possibility, you consider some options but in the end you still assume ems will be just like us. Of course, if ems are not like us, then a lot of the detailed sociological research produced on humans would not be very applicable to their world and the book would have to be shorter, but then it might be a better one. In one chapter you mention that lesbian women make more money and therefore lesbian ems might make money as well. This comes at the end of many levels of suspension of disbelief, making the sociology\/gender\/psychology chapters quite exhausting.At his blog, J Storrs Hall said something similar:Robin\u2019s scenario precludes some of these concerns by being very specific to a single possibility: that we have the technology to copy off any single particular human brain, we don\u2019t understand them well enough to modify them arbitrarily. Thus they have to operated in a virtual reality that is reasonably close to a simulated physical world. There is a good reason for doing it this way, of course: that\u2019s the only uploading scenario in which all the social science studies and papers and results and so forth can be assumed to still apply.Most social scientists, and especially most economists, don\u2019t see what they have learned as being quite so fragile. Yes it is nice to check abstract theories against concrete anecdotes, but in fact most who publish papers do little such checking, and their results only suffer modestly from the lack. Yes being non-biological, or messing a bit with brain design, may make some modest differences. But most social science theory just isn\u2019t that sensitive to such details. As I say in the book:Our economic theories apply reasonably well not only to other classes and regions within rich nations today, but also to other very different nations today and to people and places thousands of years ago. Furthermore, formal economic models apply widely even though quite alien creatures usually populate them, that is, selfish rational strategic agents who never forget or make mistakes. If economic theory built using such agents can apply to us today, it can plausibly apply to future ems.The human brain is a very large complex legacy system whose designer did not put a priority on making it easy to understand, modify, or redesign. That should greatly limit the rate at which big useful redesign is possible.","77":" Spaceship Earth Explores Culture Space  Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. (more)Many love science fiction stories of brave crews risking their lives to explore strange new spaces, stories much like the older adventure stories about European explorers risking their lives centuries ago to explore new places on Earth. (Yes, often to conquer and enslave the locals.) Many lament that we don\u2019t have as many real such explorer stories today, and they say that we should support more human space exploration now in order to create such real heroic exploration stories. Even though human space exploration is crazy expensive now, and offers few scientific, economic, or humanity-survival gains anytime soon. They say the good stories will be worth all that cost.Since Henry George first invoked it in 1879, many have used the metaphor of Spaceship Earth to call attention to our common vulnerability and limited resources:Spaceship Earth \u2026 is a world view encouraging everyone on Earth to act as a harmonious crew working toward the greater good. \u2026 \u201cwe must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions\u201d \u2026 \u201cWe travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil.\u201d (more)In this post, I want to suggest that Spaceship Earth is in fact a story of a brave crew risking much to explore a strange new territory. But the space we explore is more cultural than physical.During the industrial era, the world economy has doubled roughly every fifteen years. Each such doubling of output has moved us into new uncharted cultural territory. This growth has put new pressures on our environment, and has resulted in large and rapid changes to our culture and social organization.This growth results mostly from innovation, and most innovations are small and well tested against local conditions, giving us little reason to doubt their local value. But all these small changes add up to big overall moves that are often entangled with externalities, coordination failures, and other reasons to doubt their net value.So humanity continues to venture out into new untried and risky cultural spaces, via changes to cultural conditions with which we don\u2019t have much experience, and which thus risk disaster and destruction. The good crew of Spaceship Earth should carefully weigh these risks when considering where and how fast to venture.Consider seven examples:While humans seem to be adapting reasonably well to global warming, we risk big lumpy disruptive changes to Atlantic currents and Antarctic ice. Ecosystems also seem to be adapting okay, but we are risking big collapses to them as well.While ancient societies gave plenty of status and rewards to fertility, today high fertility behaviors are mostly seen as low status. This change is entwined with complex changes in gender norms and roles, but one result is that human fertility is falling toward below replacement in much of the world, and may fall much further. Over centuries this might produce a drastic decrease in world population, and productivity-threatening decreases in the scale of world production.While the world has become much more peaceful over the last century, this has been accompanied by big declines in cultural support for military action and tolerance for military losses. Is the world now more vulnerable to conquest by a new military power with more local cultural support and tolerance for losses?Farmer era self-control and self-discipline has weakened over time, in part via weaker religion. This has weakened cultural support for work and cultural suspicion of self-indulgence in sex, drugs, and media. So we now see less work and more drug addiction. How far will we slide?Via new media, we are exploring brave new worlds of how to make friends, form identities, achieve status, and learn about the world. As many have noted, these new ways risk many harms to happiness and social capital.Innovation was once greatly aided by tinkering, i.e., the ability to take apart and change familiar devices. Such tinkering is much less feasible in modern devices. Increasing regulation and risk aversion is also interfering with innovation. Are we as a result risking cultural support for innovation?Competition between firms has powered rapid growth, but winning bets on intangible capital is allowing leading firms to increasingly dominate industries. Does this undermine the competition that we\u2019ve relied on so far to power growth?The most common framing today for such issues is one of cultural war. You ask yourself which side feels right to you, commiserate with your moral allies, then puff yourself up with righteous indignation against those who see things differently, and go to war with them. But we might do better to frame these as reasonable debates on how much to risk as we explore culture space.In a common scene from exploration stories, a crew must decide if to take a big risk. Or choose among several risks. Some in the crew see a risk as worth the potential reward, while others want to search longer for better options, or retreat to try again another day. They may disagree on the tradeoff, but they all agree that both the risks and the rewards are real. It is just a matter of tradeoff details.We might similarly frame key \u201cvalue\u201d debates as reasonable differing judgements on what chances to take as spaceship Earth explores culture space. Those who love new changes could admit that we are taking some chances in adopting them so quickly, with so little data to go on, while those who are suspicious of recent changes could admit that many seem to like their early effects. Rather than focus on directly evaluating changes, we might focus more on setting up tracking systems to watch for potential problems, and arranging for repositories of old culture practices that might help us to reverse changes if things go badly. And we might all see ourselves as part of a grand heroic adventure story, wherein a mostly harmonious crew explores a great strange cosmos of possible cultures.","78":" Marriage Futures  After a couple announce their engagement, but before they tie the knot, talk among friends and family often turns to how long the marriage will last.  When folks are not optimistic, they may wonder if they should tell the couple.  But they usually say nothing, depriving the couple of crucial signals to reconsider.Imagine a web site where you could start a market to bet on the duration of any upcoming or current marriage.  That is, you could buy or sell assets that pay in proportion to the number of years the marriage will last, if it begins, up to some maximum of say fifty years.  If the marriage never starts, you get your money back. Once it became widely known that such market prices are often available, wedding guests and the couple would probably check out the price before the wedding, coordinating everyone\u2019s expectations about the marriage.   Added 27Oct: You can estimate marriages here just for fun, and Ravages made a similar betting suggestion. Pride would likely induce the couple to try to push up the price estimate of their marriage duration.  Perhaps disgruntled rivals would try to push the price down.  Both would provide crucial liquidity to get the market going.  And successful couples would get a great fifty year wedding present from cashing in their bets. Since weddings and divorces are a matter of public record, there should be little dispute on who won these bets.  The long time scale would mean that the bets should be of assets bonds or stock index funds, which increase in value over time.  The market price would usually be somewhat lopsided, usually being closer to zero than to the maximum time, which might bias the price up a bit, but that doesn\u2019t seem a big problem.These markets could create incentives for outsiders to hurt the marriage, such as causing or spreading rumors about cheating.  But my guess is that the suspicion of hidden powers out there trying to hurt the marriage would on average tie the couple to each other all the stronger. If the cost of setting up these markets became low, people might set them up for couples they know who are not yet engaged, as a way to encouraging such couples to consider (or reject) engagement.  Overall marriage futures could provide quite socially valuable advice on such important decisions.  In the US, however, gambling laws would prevent cash versions of these markets.From a conversation with Steven Landsburg.","79":" Open Thread  Here is our monthly place to discuss Overcoming Bias topics that have not appeared in recent posts.","80":" All Hail William Napier  William Napier was born in 1940 and got his Ph.D. three years after his B.S., in 1966.   After a career as a professional astronomer, he published his first book of fiction in 1998, at the age of 58, and published three more over the next five years.But I still would not have heard of Napier had I not read his two brilliant 2007 Astrobiology papers, published when he was 67.  The first argued comets were a likely origin of life:A single comet of radius 10 km \u2026 contains [about] as much clay \u2026 as \u2026 early Earth. \u2026 Our Solar System is surrounded by about 1011 comets \u2026 A cometary interior provides a stable, aqueous, organic-rich environment for around 106 years.The second showed that life could spread across a galaxy when via giant molecular clouds reliably collecting life from the stars they drift near, and then passing that life on to a few of the thousands of new stars they create.  I now honor Napier by quoting lots of his detail:The Solar System passes within 5 pc of star-forming nebulae every 50\u2013100 million years, a distance which can be bridged by protected micro-organisms ejected from the Earth by impacts. Such encounters disturb the Oort cloud, and induce episodes of bombardment of the Earth and the ejection of microbiota from its surface. Star-forming regions within the nebulae encountered may thus be seeded by signi\ufb01cant numbers of microorganisms. \u2026 Dissemination of microbiota proceeds most rapidly through the molecular ring of the Galaxy. \u2026The Oort cloud comprises perhaps 1011 comets at distances up to 50,000 AU from the sun, with orbital periods up to ~4 Myr. The mass of the system probably lies in the range 0.1\u2013250 Earth masses.  \u2026 Surges in \ufb02ux (\u2018 comet showers \u2019 \u2026) are expected owing to discrete perturbations of the Oort cloud. Giant molecular clouds have masses characteristically M~5 x 105 Msun.  \u2026.  The bombardment pro\ufb01le resulting from a grazing encounter with a [500K Msun] GMC [Giant Molecular Cloud], an event which has probably happened \ufb01ve to ten times in Solar System history. \u2026 [has] a distinct bombardment episode, declining with a half-width ~3 Myr.  \u2026Bombardment episodes can be seen with some degree of statistical con\ufb01dence in the terrestrial impact record of the past 250 million years. \u2026 A weak periodicity does seem to be present \u2026 The periodicity may be ~36 Myr \u2026 It likely has a Galactic provenance, consistent with the Sun\u2019s vertical motion through the Galactic disc and the tendency for nebulae to be concentrated towards the plane. \u2026In the inner planetary system, \u2026 a 1 m boulder would be destroyed by erosion in 19,000 to 230,000 yr. \u2026  Metre-sized boulders ejected from Earth may then be collisionally reduced to submicrometre particles on timescales of a few centuries, whereupon Solar radiation pressure will expel them from the Solar System. \u2026 The meteoroid attains a terminal velocity v ~13 km\/s and travels 1.9 pc from the Solar System in 140,000 years. \u2026 A 1 mm grain with a graphite coat 0.02 mm thick would achieve this. This timescale may be compared with the half-life of deep-frozen microbiota against destruction by Galactic cosmic rays, which according to Mileikowsky et al. (2000) is ~75 000 yr for some micro-organisms. Thus a signi\ufb01cant fraction of microbiota would survive exposure to Galactic cosmic rays while travelling out to a few parsecs from the Solar System (arguments have been given to suggest much longer survival times). The Galactic cosmic ray count within a GMC is low and will increase the half-life taken for the biosphere radius calculation.The Solar System may thus be surrounded by a biosphere extending out to at least ~5 pc, capable of infecting a star-forming nebula during a close encounter. One readily \ufb01nds that, conservatively, ~3 x 1015 g of unshocked surface material from the Earth is injected into the GMC during the ~3 Myr of the passage. Furthermore, as this material is largely in micrometre-sized particles, \u2026 If there are 106 microorganisms per gram of terrestrial material ejected, \u2026Massive nebulae are scavengers, disturbing the comet clouds of star systems penetrating them and gathering up the expelled dust, which will include any microbiota ejected in unshocked planetary material. A typical GMC may have ~50 000 stars passing through it at any time. They are also sites of star and planet formation (an OB association may contain several thousand stars) and so there is a clear potential for propagating life throughout the Galaxy as a chain reaction. \u2026Diffusion of life throughout the Galactic habitable zone would proceed most rapidly through the molecular ring of the Galaxy and spread from there. The mean interval between signi\ufb01cant encounters in the ring is ~50 Myr. In the ring, only 1.12 habitable planets or their precursor material need be inoculated per encounter with a molecular cloud for panspermia to go to completion within the age of the Galaxy. Two inoculations per encounter would lead to complete dissemination in less than 400 Myr.Some criticism of these papers here, which noted:The [Falkowski] team recovered highly degraded microbial DNA from 8 million-year-old Antarctic ice and estimated that DNA on Earth has a half-life of only about 1.1 million years. In other words, every 1.1 million years, half of the DNA disappears.But see also this elaboration by Chandra Wickramasinghe, and this confirmation of the comet claims:Liquid water in comets, once considered impossible, now appears to be almost certain.New evidence has come from the discovery of clay minerals in comet Tempel 1, which compliments the indirect evidence in aqueous alteration of carbonaceous chondrites. Infrared spectral indication of clay is con\ufb01rmed by modelling data.See also these suspiciously red comets, and Richard Hoover\u2019s picts and vid of suspiciously lifelike materials in an older-than-Earth meteorite.","81":" Ban Election Arguments?  While Intrade has betting markets on the US presidential election, they are unregulated and of questionable US legality. Nadex went through the expensive legal hoops to apply for permission to run a regulated market. Last week:The CFTC determined that the contracts involve gaming and are contrary to the public interest. (more)Why?It could unduly influence election results. \u2026 the contracts could run afoul of the election process if traders had financial incentives to vote for particular candidates. (more)They still allow election betting at the Iowa Electronic Markets, where stakes are limited to $500. They still let people work for campaigns and administrations, which gives them financial incentives to vote for certain candidates. And they let candidates take positions favoring some industries, occupations, and locations, over others, which gives people financial incentives to vote for and against candidates.We also let people tell other people which candidates they favor, which gives people non-financial incentives to vote for those candidates later. And since every bet for a candidate is matched with a bet against that candidate, whenever a betting market gives anyone a financial incentive to vote for a candidate, it at the same time gives someone else a financial incentive to vote against that candidate. Why are all the rest of these \u201cdue\u201d influences, while bets are \u201cundue\u201d influences?Paula Dwyer argues:Naked credit default swaps on Greek sovereign debt (buying a CDS without owning the underlying debt) are no more than a bet on a Greek default. Will the CFTC be barring them, too? (more)Law and Economics professors Eric Posner and Glen Weyl support the CFTC:Financial instruments that serve primarily as a means of speculation rather than hedging should be banned \u2026 Suppose that two individuals, neither of whom uses or produces oil, harbor different opinions about the future price of oil and decide to wager on it. Both parties willingly participate, because they think they\u2019re each getting the best of their confused counterparty. Clearly, both of them cannot gain from this transaction, and the wager itself creates rather than reduces risk. While each party thinks it is getting the better of the other, both agree that on average both of them will be worse off because on average they will win and lose on the same number of bets, and both of their incomes will be less smooth and predictable on account of their wagering. As a consequence, this sort of speculation is socially harmful. \u2026In controlled and appropriate contexts, [gambling] can be a source of entertainment for people who are aware of and willing to accept the potential losses. But participants in financial markets are usually seeking financial security rather than entertainment, and they typically have little sense of the risks they are taking on. \u2026 A second potential benefit of allowing trading in derivatives is the information that they provide to market participants. The knowledge of the likely outcome of the presidential election provided by the wisdom of the crowds is useful for planning by businesses, individuals, and governments. But that information is only valuable to the extent that it enables real economic decisions to be made more effectively.Consider: why should we let people argue on elections? Similar to the above, one could say:People mainly argue in the hope of winning arguments, thinking that they are taking advantage of confused opponents. While each side hopes that further events and discussions will reveal them to have been more in the right, both sides understand that this can\u2019t happen for both of them. Yes, people might argue just to have fun, but election pundits seem serious \u2013 wanting more to prove the other side wrong. And most people who argue politics seem to have little understanding of what they are talking about. Yes, arguments can produce useful info for others, but the value of the info produced in election arguments is small compared to the time lost arguing. Thus we should ban arguments on elections.Election arguers and bettors both seem motivated by a similar mix of enjoying the process and hoping to win. But the info produced by bettors is far more persuasive, reliable, and useful \u2013 you have far better reasons to believe betting market odds than whatever the apparent winner of a political argument has claimed.You might counter that people sometimes argue about who should win an election, rather than who will win. But betting markets can collect info on that topic as well \u2013 we can bet on outcomes after the election conditional on who wins the election. These sort of markets would be enormously helpful to tell voters about which candidate will best promote health, peace, or prosperity. Yet such markets are now banned because they might \u201cunduly\u201d influence elections, or let people \u201cwaste\u201d their time \u201carguing\u201d about elections. Heaven forbid we should waste time figuring out which candidate would actually help us more.","82":" Economist As Scrooge  In Today\u2019s Weekly Standard, Harvard\u2019s Harvey Mansfield writes on \"Saving Christmas From The Economists\":Economists \u2026 have become critical of the frenzy of Christmas gift-making. \u2026 Economic analysis says that consumers would be better off making their own purchases, buying things they know they want, rather than trying to get the benefit out of gifts bought ignorantly for them by others. Worse than ignorance is the imposition of the giver\u2019s own taste or views, \u2026 The economy as a whole\u2026 would be better off without the surge in sales of Christmas gifts at the end of the year.  \u2026  In this aspect economics is \u2026 a way of life\u2013the life of efficiency and frugality. This life is bourgeois, middle-class, and opposed to your wasting your money on whims, as do rich aristocrats. \u2026To justify Christmas giving we need to look past the hasty confusion of the \"consumer,\" so described by economics, to the soul of the giver and see how it is improved by the virtue of generosity. The benefit of giving is more to the giver than to the receiver\u2013a paradox better known to common sense and the Bible than to economics. For having a generous soul saves one from living in the relentless anxiety of never knowing whether one has enough for oneself. \u2026 And let us not forget the advantage of generosity to liberty. The commonest form of slavery is slavery to money, and generosity is a kind of liberation as well as utility for yourself.Economists have explained their critique often enough, and Mansfield has access to enough good economists, so I have to suspect Mansfield willfully misunderstands here \u2014 it must be more fun to defend Tiny Tim against mean old Scrooge.  But two points bear repeating:Economists fully grant that gift exchange is good if it just directly produces enough \"warm fuzzy feelings.\"  I don\u2019t see that exchanging gifts obviously makes us more virtuous, or reduces fear from want or \"slavery\" to money.  But directly creating valued feelings can be enough.Economists widely suspect that gifts are signals, given to show that we care, with the warm feelings coming more directly from seeing that others believe that we care.  This might seem a subtle distinction, but it can make a huge difference.  Signaling can easily lead to excess signaling, where most everyone can be better off with signals discouraged.  If we could not give Christmas gifts, no one would think us uncaring for not giving them.My best guess is that Christmas gift exchange is another admirable activity, of which we have too much.Added 15Jan:  Mansfield replies (via email):Thanks very much for your attention to my piece and to my argument.  To begin a reply I would say in speaking of caring and signaling you are too much concerned with others.  Virtue as virtue is concerned with the perfection of one\u2019s self first and foremost.  Once you start looking over your shoulder at its effect on others, you encounter the difficulty you mention of distinguishing false concern, which is really your advantage, from the real thing, the advantage of another.But you are a genuine homo economicus and I would not have you otherwise.Let us assume you are right, that giving creates virtue, and that the usual concern about appearances is less virtuous.  Even so, by our (economists\u2019) evaluation criteria, the question is: how much do people actually want to be virtuous in your sense?  We don\u2019t recommend policy that creates virtue unless people actually want virtue; if people mostly want appearances, then we want people to get appearances.","83":" Anti-Depressants Fail  A meta-analysis of SSRI anti-depressant medication, published in Feb \u201908, found almost no effect.  Here is the data:Following the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), we requested from the FDA all publicly releasable information about the clinical trials for efficacy conducted for marketing approval of fluoxetine, venlafaxine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram, the six most widely prescribed antidepressants approved between 1987 and 1999, which represent all but one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) approved during the study period. \u2026 Although sponsors are required to submit information on all trials, the FDA public disclosure did not include mean changes for nine trials that were deemed adequate and well controlled but that failed to achieve a statistically significant benefit for drug over placebo. \u2026  we present analyses only for those [four] medications for which mean change scores on all trials were available.Here are the results:Compared with placebo, the new-generation antidepressants do not produce clinically significant improvements in depression in patients who initially have moderate or even very severe depression, but show significant effects only in the most severely depressed patients. The findings also show that the effect for these patients seems to be due to decreased responsiveness to placebo, rather than increased responsiveness to medication. Given these results, the researchers conclude that there is little reason to prescribe new-generation antidepressant medications to any but the most severely depressed patients unless alternative treatments have been ineffective.And this doesn\u2019t take any account of leaky placebo effects, whereby drug side-effects convince people they have the real drug.  Given their severe side-effects, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d advise anti-depressants even when other treatments have been ineffective.

Previous research suggests part-time telecommuters do not communicate less frequently with managers. \u2026 After four years of experience, the average male telecommuter will earn about 6.9% less than a non-telecommuter. (more)Telecommuting requires the use of various types of media to communicate, such as the telephone and email. Emails have a time lag that does not allow for immediate feedback; telephone conversations make it harder to decipher the emotions of the person or team on the phone; and both of these forms of communication do not allow one to see the other person. Typical organization communication patterns are thus altered in telecommuting. For instance, teams using computer-mediated communication with computer conferencing take longer to make group decisions than face-to-face groups. (more)Decades ago many futurists predicted that many workers would soon telecommute, and empty out cities. Their argument seemed persuasive: workers who work mainly on computers, or who don\u2019t have to move much physical product, seem able to achieve enough coordination to do their jobs via phone, email, and infrequent in-person meetings. And huge cost savings could come from avoiding central city offices, homes near them, and commuting between the two. (For example, five firms might share the same offices, with each firm using them one day per week.)But it hasn\u2019t remotely happened that way. And the big question is: why?Some say telecommuters would shirk and not work as much, but it is hard to see that would remain much of a problem with a constant video feed watching them. Bryan Caplan favors a signaling explain, that we show up in person to show our commitment to the firm. But a firm should prefer employees who show devotion via more total work, instead of wasting hours on the road. Yes inefficient signaling equilibria can exist, but firms have many ways to push for this alternate equilibrium.The standard proximate cause, described in the quote above, is that workers and their bosses get a lot of detailed emotional info via frequent in-person meetings. Such detailed emotional info can help to build stronger feelings of mutual trust and affiliation. But the key question is, why are firms willing to pay so much for that? How does it help firm productivity enough to pay for its huge costs?My guess: frequent detailed emotional info helps political coalitions, even if not firms. Being able to read detailed loyalty signals is central to maintaining political coalitions. The strongest coalitions take over firms and push policies that help them resist their rivals. If a firm part adopted local policies that weakened the abilities of locals to play politics, that part would be taken over by coalitions from other parts of the firm, who would then push for policies that help them. A lack of telecommuting is only one of a long list of examples of inefficient firm policies than can be reasonably be attributed to coalition politics.Some people hope that very high resolution telepresence could finally give enough detailed emotional info to make telecommuting workable. And that might indeed give enough info to build strong mutual trust and loyalty. But it is hard to make very high resolution telepresence feel natural, and we still far from having enough bandwidth to cheaply send that much info.Furthermore, by the time we do we may also have powerful robust ways to fake that info. That is, we might have software that takes outgoing video and audio feeds and edits them to remove signs of disloyalty, to make people seem more trusting and trustworthy than they actually are. And if we all know this is possible, we won\u2019t trust what we see in telepresence.So, for telepresence to actually foster enough loyalty and trust to make telecommuting viable, not only does it need to feel comfortable and natural and give very high bandwidth info, but the process would need to be controlled by some trusted party, who ensures that people aren\u2019t faking their appearances in ways that make it hard to read real feelings. Setting up a system like that would be much more challenging that just distributing something like Skype software.Of course eventually humans might have chips under their skin to manipulate their sight and sound in real physical meetings. And then they might want ways to assure others aren\u2019t using those. But that is probably much further off. (And of course ems might always \u201cfake\u201d their physical appearance.)Again, I have hopes, but only weak hopes, for telepresence allowing for mass human telecommuting.Added 3July: Perhaps I could have been clearer. The individual telecommuter could clearly be at a political disadvantage by not being part of informal gossip and political conversation. He would have fewer useful allies, and they would thus prefer that he or she not telecommute.","85":" Compelling \u2260 Accurate  Bryan Caplan:As a rule, I don\u2019t care for \u201chard sci-fi.\u201d  In fact, artistically speaking, I normally dislike true stories of any kind.  And I barely care about continuity errors.  When I read novels or watch movies, I crave what I call \u201cemotional truth.\u201d ..  \u201cit\u2019s the idea of becoming someone else for a little while. Being inside another skin.

A well-told story is designed to maximize the audiences\u2019 identification with the characters .. you know a creator has succeeded when you temporarily lose yourself in the story.Many have said similar things. For example, Jerome Bruner:There are two modes of cognitive functioning, two modes of thought, each providing distinctive ways of ordering experience, of constructing reality. The two (though complementary) are irreducible to one another. .. Each .. has operating principles of its own and its own criteria of well-formedness. They differ radically in their procedures for verification. A good story and a well-formed argument are different natural kinds. Both can be used as means for convincing another. Yet what they convince of is fundamentally different: arguments convince one of their truth, stories of their lifelikeness. The one verifies by eventual appeal to procedures for establishing formal and empirical proof. The other establishes not truth but verisimilitude. ..\u201cGreat\u201d storytelling, inevitably, is about compelling human plights that are \u201caccessible\u201d to readers. But at the same time, the plights must be set forth with sufficient subjunctivity to allow them to be rewritten by the reader, rewritten so as to allow play for the reader\u2019s imagination.Yes, readers (or viewers) value stories where readers lose themselves, feel like they are inside character inner lives, and identify with those characters. To readers, such stories feel \u201clifelike\u201d \u2014 in some important way \u201clike\u201d real and true events. And yes, surely this is because these best stories do in fact match some template in reader minds, a template knitted in part from the many details of the world that readers have witnessed during their lives.But, such stories are much better described as \u201ccompelling\u201d than \u201ctrue.\u201d As a large literature has shown, the stories that we like differ in many big and systematic ways from real life events. Stories differ not only in external physical and social environments, but also in the personalities and preferences of individuals. Furthermore, even conditional on those things, stories also differ in the feelings that individuals have and the choices that they make.We understand some but not all things about why people are built to prefer unrealistic stories. But there seems little doubt that the stories we like are in fact unrealistic. Compelling but not \u201ctrue.\u201dI\u2019m not denying that some stories are more realistic, I\u2019m doubting that the stories that we get more lost in are in fact mainly those more realistic stories.","86":" Uninsured ER Fallacy  Robert Samuelson:The uninsured, it\u2019s said, use emergency rooms for primary care.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s untrue.  A study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that the insured accounted for 83 percent of emergency-room visits, reflecting their share of the population. After Massachusetts adopted universal insurance, emergency-room use remained higher than the national average, an Urban Institute study found. More than two-fifths of visits represented non-emergencies. Of those, a majority of adult respondents to a survey said it was \u201cmore convenient\u201d to go to the emergency room or they couldn\u2019t \u201cget [a doctor\u2019s] appointment as soon as needed.\u201d \u2026 Medicare\u2019s introduction in 1966 produced no reduction in mortality; some studies of extensions of Medicaid for children didn\u2019t find gains.HT Tim Starr.","87":" Are Women Picky?  In almost all speed-dating events, women sit in stationary positions and men rotate to talk with each of them. When Finkel and Eastwick set up a dating event like that, the standard result bore out \u2014 women were more selective.  But when they reversed the roles and had women rotate, that was no longer the case. Suddenly, the men became more selective and the women less so.So it seems women are pickier because our institutions make them pickier.  If speed dating was organized to instead make men pickier, I\u2019m guessing men would like it more, but women would soon just not show up to such events.  So yes there is a sense in which women are pickier, but it is more in wanting institutions that make them picky, rather that in being pickier given neutral institutions.More tidbits from the same source:In a 2005 study, they looked at whether the characteristics singles say they want in a partner match what they actually pursue. On paper, women reported a greater desire for earning potential and status; men were more interested in physical attractiveness. In person at speed-dating events, that discrepancy went away \u2014 \u201cwomen want really good-looking men every bit as much as men want really good-looking women,\u201d Finkel says. And financial prospects were no less important to men than women.\u2026 Another of Finkel and Eastwick\u2019s studies found that when it comes to platonic relationships, if a person tends to like everyone, that goodwill is more likely to be reciprocated. But in romantic relationships, that wasn\u2019t the case. If a single guy digs all the women in the room, Finkel explains, \u201cthe women don\u2019t like him back.\u201d  The turn-on, he continues, comes when a person feels \u201cuniquely desired.\u201dIn the far view of what we want, men want looks while women want money, but in the near view, men and women want pretty much the same thing.  Is this far view of what we want more what we want others to think we want, or is something else going on?Added:  As Andy suggests, these seem explainable by far view looking more to long term relations, while near view looks to short term relations.  In far view women want to be pickier, and want men with money, even if they aren\u2019t naturally inclined in these directions in near view.","88":" Against Interesting Details  From the December Journal of Experimental Psychology:In Experiment 1, students received an illustrated booklet, PowerPoint presentation, or narrated animation that explained 6 steps in how a cold virus infects the human body. The material included 6 high-interest details mainly about the role of viruses in sex or death (high group) or 6 low-interest details consisting of facts and health tips about viruses (low group). The low group outperformed the high group across all 3 media on a subsequent test of problem-solving transfer (d = .80) but not retention (d = .05). In Experiment 2, students who studied a PowerPoint lesson explaining the steps in how digestion works performed better on a problem-solving transfer test if the lesson contained 7 low-interest details rather than 7 high-interest details (d = .86), but the groups did not differ on retention (d = .26). In both experiments, as the interestingness of details was increased, student understanding decreased (as measured by transfer). Results are consistent with a cognitive theory of multimedia learning, in which highly interesting details sap processing capacity away from deeper cognitive processing of the core material during learning.For this reason I tend to disagree with most people about who are the best speakers and writers.  Most people prefer those with lots of interesting tidbits; I prefer those that stay focused on and deliver a key interesting point.","89":" Idea Talkers Clump  I keep encountering people who are mad at me, indignant even, for studying the wrong scenario. While my book assumes that brain emulations are the first kind of broad human-level AI, they expect more familiar AI, based on explicitly-coded algorithms, to be first.Now the prospect of human-level ordinary AI is definitely what more people are talking about today \u2013 the topic is in fashion. There are AI companies, demos, conferences, media articles, and more serious intellectual discussion. In fact, I\u2019d estimate that there is now at least one hundred times as much attention given to the scenario of human level AI based on explicit coding (including machine learning code) than to brain emulations.But I very much doubt that ordinary AI first is over one hundred times as probable as em-based AI first. In fact, I\u2019ll happily take bets at a factor of ten. You pay me $1000 if em-AI comes first, and I pay you $100 if other AI comes first.In addition, due to diminishing returns, intellectual attention to future scenarios should probably be spread out more evenly than are probabilities. The first efforts to study each scenario can pick the low hanging fruit to make faster progress. In contrast, after many have worked on a scenario for a while there is less value to be gained from the next marginal effort on that scenario.Yes, sometimes there can be scale economies to work on a topic; enough people need to do enough work to pass a critical threshold of productivity. But I see little evidence of that here, and much evidence to the contrary. Even within the scope of working on my book I saw sharply diminishing returns to continued efforts. So even if em-based AI had only 1% the chance of the other scenario, we\u2019d want much more than 1% of thinkers to study it. At least we would if our goal were better understanding.But of course that is not usually the main goal of individual thinkers. We are more eager to jump on bandwagons than to follow roads less traveled. All those fellow travelers validate us and our judgement. We prefer to join and defend a big tribe against outsiders, especially smaller weaker outsiders.So instead of praising my attention to a neglected if less-likely topic, those who think em-AI less likely mostly criticize me for studying the wrong scenario. And continue to define topics of articles, conferences, special journal issues, etc. to exclude em-AI scenarios.And this is how it tends to work in general in the world of ideas. Idea talkers tend to clump onto the topics that others have discussed lately, leaving topics outside the fashionable clumps with less attention relative to their importance. So if you are a thinker with the slack and independence to choose your own topics, an easy way to make disproportionate intellectual progress is to focus on neglected topics.Of course most intellectuals already know this, and choose otherwise.Added:  Never mind about effort less proportional than chances; Owen Cotton-Barratt reminded me that if value diminishes with log of effort, optimal scenario effort is proportional to probability.Added 11Oct: Anders Sandberg weighs in.","90":" What Do We Owe The World?  We each owe some degree of consideration to our close associates, and to larger groups with which we associate. But what do we owe the larger world and universe?Some of us think we should each put in some effort to improve that universe. Not just that this would be nice, but that we are morally obligated to do so. But how should we think about this obligation?We could try to collect a long list of specific things different people should do for the world, and how those things vary with context. But is there a simpler more general way to describe these obligations?We can think of ourself as made up of many smaller selves, at each moment in time, and in each possible world. And then standard expected utility theory says that we maximize a weighted sum across these many sub-selves. So a natural way to include the rest of the universe is to expand this weighted sum to include every other creature, and their many component selves.The relative weight we put on others might vary with their distance in spacetime, and with their similarity to us. But a general problem with this approach is that in many scenarios we will either want to do near nothing or near everything. If we consider some large group of others, then as we increase the weight we put on members of that group, at first we will want to do very little for them, and then as the weight passes a key threshold we suddenly switch to wanting to put most all of our efforts into helping them. The weight must be finely tuned to induce intermediate efforts.If intermediate levels of help sound more reasonable, one way to get that is to talk in terms of a budget: we might each have an obligation to spend at least some fixed fraction of our resources helping the world. Resources such as money, time, reputation, etc. The simplest version of this would require the same fraction for everyone, though more complex versions could make this vary with context.Bryan Caplan\u2019s new book is titled How Evil Are Politicians?, based on this essay wherein he seems to embrace something like a budget obligation story, except with politicians having much larger budget obligations:If you\u2019re in a position to pass or enforce laws, lives and freedom are in your hands. Common decency requires \u2026 politicians to make \u2026 intellectual hygiene their top priority. Until they calmly recuse themselves from their society and energetically weigh a wide range of moral arguments, they have no business lifting a political finger. At this point, the iniquity of practicing politicians should be clear. How much time and mental energy does the average politician pour into moral due diligence? A few hours a year seems like a high estimate. They don\u2019t just fall a tad short of their moral obligations. They\u2019re too busy passing laws and giving orders to face the possibility that they\u2019re wielding power illegitimately.To check on all this, I did a series of Twitter polls asking what fraction of their resources different kinds of people are obligated to spend trying to help the world. Here are the resulting (median of lognormal-fit) % estimates:The basic % of budget moral framing seems confirmed by many answering these questions and few complaining about the framing. Furthermore, respondents do seem to think this budget varies with type of person, and agree with Caplan that politicians have much higher obligations.However, respondents had enormously divergent opinions on what is that obligation budget % (median standard dev. is a factor of ~18), and even the middle estimates in the chart above seem to me to vary way too much across types of people. It seems to me unfair to demand far more efforts by others than you are willing to make. And it seems disrespectful to demand far less from other kinds of people, as if you don\u2019t see them as sufficiently human to hold them to moral standards.This looks to me more like a status story, wherein we try to hold higher status people to higher moral standards, as some sort of \u201cprogressive taxation\u201d of status. And while progressive taxation might make sense for governments, having moral obligations vary this strongly with status just doesn\u2019t make much sense of my moral intuitions. We should all try to help others, at least to some similarly modest degree.Added 10a: The prior numbers in the table were wrong due to a math mistake, now fixed.","91":" Stupider Than You Realize  A common bias among the smart is to overestimate how smart everyone else is.  This was certainly my experience in moving from top rank universities as a student to a mid rank university as a teacher.  A better intuition for common abilities can be found by browsing the US National Assesment of Adult Literacy sample questions.For example, in 1992 out of a random sample of US adults, 7% could not do item SCOR300, which is to find the expiration date on a driver\u2019s license.  26% could not do item AB60303, which is to check the \u201cPlease Call\u201d box on a phone message slip when they\u2019ve been told:James Davidson phones and asks to speak with Ann Jones, who is at a meeting.

It confirms (with Caplan\u2019s Case Against Education) a picture wherein ordinary people are pretty clueless about a big institution in their lives. This cluelessness also seems to apply to many other life areas, such as medicine, charity, politics, etc. In each area, most people don\u2019t seem to understand very basic things, like what exactly is the product, and what are the incentives of professionals?That is, we each live in many complex social systems, such as political, transport, medical, religious, food, and school systems. Due to our poor understanding of such systems, we have low abilities to make intelligent personal choices about them, and even worse abilities to usefully contribute to efforts to reform them. This suggests a key criteria for evaluating social systems: understandability.When we don\u2019t understand our social systems, we can be seen as having little agency regarding them. They are like the weather; they exist, and may be good or bad, but we are too ignorant to do much about them. If a situation is bad, we can\u2019t work to make it better. Some elites might have agency re such institutions, but not the rest of us. So a key question is: can we reform or create social institutions that are more understandable, to allow ordinary people to have more agency regarding the institutions in their lives?One possible solution is to use meta-institutions, like academia, news media, or government regulators, that we may better understand and trust. We might, for example, support a particular reform to our medical system based on the recommendation of an academic institution. Our understanding of academia as a meta-institution could give us agency, even when we were ignorant of the institutions of medicine.As an analogy, imagine that someone visits a wild life refuge. If this visitor does not understand the plants and animals in this area, they might reasonably fear the consequences of interacting with any given plant or animal, or of entering any given region. In contrast, when accompanied by a tour guide who can advise on what is safe versus dangerous, they might relax. But only if they have good reason to think this guide roughly shares their interests.  If your guide is a nephew who inherits your fortune if you die, you may be much less relaxed.So here\u2019s a key question: is there, at some level of abstraction, a key understandable institution by which we can usefully choose and influence many other parts of our social world? If we think we understand this meta institution well enough to trust it, that could give us substantial agency regarding key large scale features of our social worlds. For example, we could add our weight to particular reform efforts, because we had good reasons to expect such reforms to on average help.Alas, academia, news media, and government regulators all seem too complex and opaque to serve in this key meta role. But three other widely used and simpler social mechanisms may be better candidates.Go with the majority. Buy the product that most other people buy, use the social habits that most others use, and have everyone vote on key big decisions. When some people know what\u2019s best, and others abstain or pick randomly, then the majority will pick what\u2019s best. Yes, there are many topic areas where people don\u2019t abstain or pick randomly when they don\u2019t know what\u2019s best. But if we can roughly guess which are the problematic topics, then in other areas we may gain at least rough agency by going with the crowd.Follow prestige. Humans have rich ancient intuitive mechanisms for coordinating on who we find impressive. These mechanisms actually scale pretty well, allowing us to form consensus on the relative prestige of nations, professions, schools, cities, etc., and via these proxies, of individuals. Related ancient mechanisms let us form consensus on elite opinion, i.e., on what prestigious people tend to think on any given topic. Yes, elites are biased toward themselves, and to express opinions that make them seem impressive. Still, we can do worse than to follow our best.Embrace Winners. Nations, cities, firms, professions, teams, media, clubs, lovers, etc. often compete, in the sense that some grow at the expense of others that shrink or disappear. Often they compete for our personal support. And often we see judge that the competition is roughly \u201cfair\u201d and open to many potential competitors. In such cases, we may embrace the winners. For example, we may try many competitors, and stick with those we like best. Or we may go with the lowest price offer, if we can control well enough for quality variations.Each of these big three mechanisms has limits, but they do seem to satisfy the requirement that they are very simple and many ordinary people can at least roughly understand why they work, and where they run into problems. Together they may cover a pretty wide range of cases. In addition, we can augment them with many other approaches. For example, we can just expose ourselves to choices and follow our intuitions on which are best. We can follow choices by those we know and trust well, those who seem to know more about a topic, and those who seem more honest in their evaluations. Together all these tricks may give us substantial agency re the social institutions in our lives.Yet those examples of how badly most people misunderstand school, medicine, etc. suggest there is vast room for improvement. And so I look for ways to do better. Not just at designing institutions that actually work, in the sense of producing efficiency, equity, generality, robustness, evolvability, etc. Not just at designing meta-institutions with these features. And not just at gaining the support of majorities or elites, or at winning many fair competitions in the world. I seek meta-mechanisms that can also be simple and clear enough to their advantages be understandable to many ordinary people.This is the context in which I\u2019d like you to see my highest hopes for prediction markets. I offer them not just as mechanisms that actually work, producing and aggregating info at a low cost. After all, there may be other complex and subtle mechanisms that experts expect to achieve similar or even somewhat better results. But the problem in that case is that ordinary people may wonder how well they can trust such expert judgements.No, I\u2019m interested in the potential for prediction markets to serve as a simple understandable meta-institution, on par with and at the level of going with the majority, following prestige, and embracing winners. Simple enough that many ordinary people can directly understand why they should work well in many applications, and also to understand roughly where their limitations lie. Yes, not everyone can understand this, but maybe most everyone could know and trust someone who does understand.","93":" Beware Mob War Strategy  The game theory is clear: it can be in your interest to make threats that it would not be in your interest to carry out. So you can gain from committing to carrying out such threats. But only if you do it right. Your commitment plan must be simple and clear enough for your audience to see when it applies to them, how it is their interest to go along with it, and that people who look like you to them have in fact been consistently following such a plan.So, for example, it probably won\u2019t work to just lash out at whomever happens to be near you whenever the universe disappoints you somehow. The universe may reorganize to avoid your lashings, but probably not by catering to your every whim. More likely, others will avoid you, or crush you. That\u2019s a bad commitment plan.Here\u2019s a good commitment plan. A well-run legal system can usefully deter crime via committing to consistently punish law violations. Such a system clearly defines violations, and shows potential violators an enforcement system wherein a substantial fraction of violations will be detected, prosecuted, and punished. Those under the jurisdiction of this law can see this fact, and understand which acts lead to which punishments. Such acts can thus be deterred.Here\u2019s another pretty good commitment plan. The main nations with nuclear weapons seem to have created a mutual expectation of \u201cmutually assured destruction.\u201d Each nation is committed to responding to a nuclear attack with a devastating symmetric attack. So devastating as to deter attack even if there is a substantial chance that such a response wouldn\u2019t happen. This commitment plan is simple, easy to understand, clearly communicated, and quite focused on particular scenarios. So far, it seems to have worked.Humans are often willing to suffer large costs to punish those who violate their moral rules. In fact, we probably evolved such moral indignation in part as a way to commit to punishing violations of our local moral norms. In small bands, with norms that were stable across many generations, members could plausibly achieve sufficient clarity and certainty about norm enforcement to deter violations via such threats. So such commitments might have had good plans in that context.But this does not imply that things would typically go well for us if we freely indulged our moral indignation inclinations in our complex modern world. For example, imagine that we encouraged, instead of discouraged, mob justice. That is, if we encouraged people to gossip to convince their friends to share their moral outrange, building off of each until they chased down and \u201clynched\u201d any who offended them.This sort of mob justice can go badly for a great many reasons. We don\u2019t actually share norms as closely as we think, mob members are often more eager to show loyalty to each other than to verify accusation accuracy, and some are willing to make misleading accusations to take down rivals. More fundamentally, we might say that mob justice goes bad because it is not based on a good commitment plan. Observers just can\u2019t predict mob justice outcomes well enough for it to usefully encourage good behavior, at least compared to a formal legal system.Now consider the subject of making peace deals to end wars. Such as the current war between Russia and Ukraine. An awful lot of people, probably a majority, of the Ukrainian supporters I\u2019ve heard from seem to be morally offended by the idea of such a peace deal in this case. Even though the usual game theory analyses of war say that there are usually peace deals that both sides would prefer at the time to continued war. (Such deals could focus on immediately verifiable terms; they needn\u2019t focus on unverifiable promises of future actions. In April 2022 Russia and Ukraine apparently had a tentative deal, scuttled due to pressure from Ukrainian allies.)Many of these peace deal opponents are willing to justify this stance in consequentialist terms: they say that we should commit to not making such deals. Which, as they are eager to point out, is a logically coherent stance due to the usual game theory analysis. We should thus \u201chold firm\u201d, \u201cteach them a lesson\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t let them get away with it\u201d, etc. All justified by game theory, they say.The problem is, I haven\u2019t seen anyone outline anything close to a good commitment plan here. Nothing remotely as clear and simple as we have with criminal law, or with mutually assured destruction. They don\u2019t clearly specify the set of situations where the commitment is to apply, the ways observers are to tell when they are in such situations, the behavior that has been committed to there, or the dataset of international events that shows that people that look like us have in fact consistently behaved in this way. Peace deal opponents (sometimes called \u201cwar mongers\u201d) instead mainly just seem to point to their mob-inflamed feelings of moral outrage.For example, some talk as if we should just ignore the fact that Russia has nuclear weapons in this war, as if we have somehow committed to doing that in order to prevent anyone from using nuclear weapons as a negotiating leverage. The claim that nations have been acting according to such a commitment doesn\u2019t seem to me at all a good summary of the history of nuclear powers. And if the claim is that we should start now to create such a commitment by just acting as if it had always existed, that seems even crazier.If we have not actually found and clearly implemented a good commitment plan, then it seems to me that we should proceed as if we have not made such a commitment. So we must act in accord with the usual game theory analysis. Which says to compromise and make peace if possible. Especially as a way to reduce the risk of a large nuclear war.The possibility of a global nuclear war seems a very big deal. Yes, war seems sacred and that inclines us toward relying on our intuitions instead of conscious calculations. It inclines us toward mob war strategy. But this issue seems plenty important enough to justify our resisting that inclination. Yes, a careful analysis may well identify some good commitment plans, after which we could think about how to move toward making commitments according to those plans.But following the vague war strategy inclinations of our mob-inflamed moral outrage seems a poor substitute for such a good plan. If we have not yet actually found and implemented a good plan, we should deal with a world where we have not made useful commitments. And so make peace, to avoid risking the destructions of war.","94":" US Politics Of Medicine  After presiding over an economy with a record disappointing performance, which usually gets incumbent presidents fired, Intrade puts Obama\u2019s chance of re-election at 79%! I attribute an important part of this to the politics of medicine. Here\u2019s recent US medical politics in a nutshell:Seniors vote a lot more, and they love their free medicine, so US politicians have long written them a blank check, leading to rapid cost increases. Wonks have long said \u201csomething must be done\u201d about costs, and the left has long wanted to expand the number with health insurance. So Obama pushed through a law requiring such an expansion, and declaring an intention to do something about costs. Later. But something, they swear.This created a vague unease among seniors that their free medicine might get cut. Vague because seniors don\u2019t really get how exactly costs might be cut. But still, cuts! Which created an opening for a Republican to get elected president by promising to never cut senior medicine. Except that the frontrunner Republican candidate was someone who had implemented a similar program when he was governor. And then he made a \u201cbold\u201d move to pick a running mate with a bold plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system. Which Romney thought would give him credit for taking problems \u201cseriously.\u201dBad move. Voters don\u2019t really like \u201cbold\u201d politicians. Since seniors have a better idea of what \u201cvouchers\u201d mean, and how exactly they lead to cuts, that let Obama more effectively attack Romney as planning to cut seniors\u2019 free medicine. Which is sticking, because although everyone says \u201csomething must be done\u201d, seniors don\u2019t actually believe that their free medicine needs to be cut. So seniors in key swing states move toward Obama, and he gets re-elected.And after the election, there\u2019s pretty much no chance Obama will let senior medicine get cut, at least in any way they could trace back to him. Nor will the next president after him. Maybe we\u2019ll go into more debt, or raise taxes, or cut military spending. But no way will they stop writing medical blank checks to seniors, and letting costs rise as they will.Here\u2019s the recent data fleshing out this public opinion story:Voters in three critical swing states broadly oppose the far-reaching changes to Medicare \u00adassociated with the Republican presidential ticket. \u2026 For seniors in Florida, Ohio and Virginia, Medicare rivals the economy as a top voting issue. And by majorities topping 70 percent, seniors say they prefer to keep Medicare as a program with guaranteed benefits, . \u2026 [Romney\u2019s] choice of Ryan \u2014 who wrote a proposal that would move Medicare toward vouchers as part of an overall attempt to curb the deficit \u2014 is considered a bold and politically risky move, given Medicare\u2019s popularity. \u2026Although seniors nationwide dislike the idea of moving away from the current system, their opposition is even more pronounced in Florida, Ohio and Virginia, where both candidates have spent weeks saturating the airwaves with Medicare attack ads. Obama hammers the Ryan plan continually, telling supporters at a campaign event in Milwaukee last Saturday that Romney and Ryan would \u201cturn Medicare into a voucher program in order to pay for tax cuts for the very wealthy.\u201d \u2026Underlying support for not changing Medicare is the widespread belief that the system is functioning smoothly. In Florida, 70 percent of all voters say the system is working well \u2014 rising to 91 percent of the state\u2019s seniors \u2014 and positive assessments of Medicare are nearly as high in the other states. \u2026 There is also a widely held public perception that changes are needed to keep Medicare sustainable for future generations. The problem for Republicans is that swelling budget deficits are not a sufficient motivator for voters. Across the three states, about three-quarters of voters say that Medicare cuts are not essential to deficit reduction.

More here and here.","96":" Moral Overconfidence  A Washington Post article from from last Saturday says:In the 2006 survey of more than 36,000 high school students, 60 percent said they cheated on a test, 82 percent said they lied to their parents about something significant and 28 percent said they stole something from a store. \u2026 92 percent said they were \"satisfied with my own ethics and character.\" About 74 percent said that \"when it comes to doing right, I am better than most people I know.\" \u2026 the percentage of students who lie, cheat or steal could be higher than the survey found.   When asked, 27 percent of the students admitted that they lied on at least one survey question.It is hard to see how 3\/4 of people could be better than most people they know about anything; moral overconfidence is a far more plausible explanation.On a similar topic, a clever set of experiments, described in \"Exploiting Moral Wiggle Room\" (and discussed at Marginal Revolution) shows that people act to appear fair, but are less fair when given even feeble excuses for their unfair behavior.Are you willing to admit that you are about as moral as most people you know?  I am.","97":" Prediction Markets Need Trial & Error  We economists have a pretty strong consensus on a few key points: 1) innovation is the main cause of long-term economic growth, 2) social institutions are a key changeable determinant of social outcomes, and 3) inducing the collection and aggregation of info is one of the key functions of social institutions. In addition, better institutional-methods for collecting and aggregating info (ICAI) could help with the key meta-problems of making all other important choices, including the choice of our other institutions, especially institutions to promote innovation. Together all these points suggest that one of the best ways that we today could help the future is to innovate better ICAI.After decades pondering the topic, I\u2019ve concluded that prediction markets (and closely related techs) are our most promising candidate for a better ICAI; they are relatively simple and robust with a huge range of potential high-value applications. But, alas, they still need more tests and development before wider audiences can be convinced to adopt them.The usual (good) advice to innovators is to develop a new tech first in the application areas where it can attract the highest total customer revenue, and also where customer value can pay for the highest unit costs. As the main direct value of ICAI is to advise decisions, we should thus seek the body of customers most willing to pay money for better decisions, and then focus, when possible, on their highest-value versions.Compared to charities, governments, and individuals, for-profit firms are more used to paying money for things that they value, including decision advice. And the decisions of such firms encompass a large fraction, perhaps most, of the decision value in our society. This suggests that we should seek to develop and test prediction markets first in the context of typical decisions of ordinary business, slanted when possible toward their highest value decisions.The customer who would plausibly pay the most here is the decision maker seeing related info, not those who want to lobby for particular decisions, nor those who want to brag about how accurate is their info. And they will usually prefer ways to elicit advice from their associates, instead of from distant curated panels of advisors.We have so far seen dozens of efforts to use prediction markets to advise decisions inside ordinary firms. Typically, users are satisfied and feel included, costs are modest, and market estimates are similarly or substantially more accurate than other available estimates. Even so, experiments typically end within a few years, often due to political disruption. For example, market estimates can undermine manager excuses (e.g., \u201cwe missed the deadline due to a rare unexpected last-minute problem\u201d), and managers dislike seeing their public estimates beaten by market estimates.Here\u2019s how to understand this: \u201cInnovation matches elegant ideas to messy details.\u201d While general thinkers can identify and hone the elegant ideas, the messy details must usually come from context-dependent trial and error. So for prediction markets, we must search in the space of detailed context-dependent ways to structure and deploy them, to find variations that cut their disruptions. First find variations that work in smaller contexts, then move up to larger trials. This seems feasible, as we\u2019ve already done so for other potentially-politically-disruptive ICAI, such as cost-accounting, AB-tests, and focus groups.Note that, being atheoretical and context-dependent, this needed experimentation poorly supports academic publications, making academics less interested. Nor can these experiments be enabled merely with money; they crucially need one or more organizations willing to be disrupted by many often-disruptive trials.Ideally those who oversee this process would be flexible, willing and able as needed to change timescales, topics, participants, incentives, and who-can-see-what structures. An d such trials should be done where those in the org feel sufficiently free to express their aversion to political disruption, to allow the search process to learn to avoid it. Alas, I have so far failed to persuade any organizations to host or fund such experimentation.This is my best guess for the most socially valuable way to spend ~<$1M. Prediction markets offer enormous promise to realize vast social value, but it seems that promise will remain only potential until someone undertakes the small-scale experiments needed to find the messy details to match its elegant ideas. Will that be you?","98":" Rational Agent Paternalism  While paternalism is about bias, it need not be about irrational bias.  In a 2003 Journal of Public Economics paper, I modeled product bans and warnings directed at completely-rational consumers, and chosen by a better-informed completely-rational regulator who only cares about economic welfare.   I found:Even ideal regulators want to lie about product quality, to correct for other market failures.Even a small temptation to lie makes consumers disbelieve most of what regulators say.Regulators who can ban sometimes do, as consumers won\u2019t believe severe warnings.Consumers believe more severe warnings from regulators who can only warn. When regulators prefer to talk up quality (e.g., in health, school, investing), both regulators and consumers are better off if regulators cannot ban.Yes, this model may be less relevant if irrational biases are central to paternalism.  But it at least gives us a concrete reference point.  Weather permitting, David Balan and I debate paternalism today.","99":" Passion Vs. Doubt  Michael Gerson has doubts on doubt:Without a doubt, doubt is useful and needed at the margins of any ideology. The world is too complex to know completely. Many of our judgments are, by nature, provisional. Those who are immune to evidence, who claim infallibility on debatable matters, are known as bores \u2013 or maybe columnists.Doubt becomes destructive as it reaches the center of a belief and becomes its substitute. A systematic skepticism may keep us from bothering our neighbor. It does not motivate a passion to fight for his or her dignity and rights. How do ambiguity and agnosticism result in dreams of justice, in altruism and honor, in sacrifices for the common good? What great reformers of American history can be explained by their elegant ambivalence? (more)Ask yourself this simple question: how confident would you need to be on a moral or political conclusion in order to work passionately for it? 99%? 90%? 75%?  If you have such an action-threshold, and this threshold is high, well then yes, to let your passion flower, you may need to lie to yourself about your confidence. So that you might actually do something.Would your overconfidence then lead you to do too many things too enthusiastically?  If so, perhaps you\u2019d do better to also allow yourself some other more graded psychological reluctance to passion, to counter this bias.But it would of course be even better if you could see the nobility and glory in doing your best as a limited but well-meaning creature. You shouldn\u2019t need to be absolutely sure of a conclusion to work sincerely and passionately for it.","100":" College Prestige Lies  Over the next two weeks my eldest son will be rejected by some colleges, accepted by others.  And then we\u2019ll likely have to make a hard choice, between cheap state schools and expensive prestigious ones (or online colleges).  A colleague told me the best econ paper on this found it doesn\u2019t matter.  From its 1999 abstract:We matched students who applied to, and were accepted by, similar colleges to try to eliminate this bias. Using the \u2026 High School Class of 1972, we find that students who attended more selective colleges earned about the same [20 years later] as students of seemingly comparable ability who attended less selective schools. Children from low-income families, however, earned more if they attended selective colleges.A 2006 NYT article confirms this:Higher education experts have this message \u2026 Pay less attention to prestige and more to \u201cfit\u201d \u2014 the marriage of interests and comfort level with factors like campus size, access to professors, instruction philosophy. \u2026 A 1999 study by Alan B. Krueger \u2026 and Stacy Dale \u2026 found that students who were admitted to both selective and moderately selective colleges earned the same no matter which they attended.as does a 2004 Atlantic Monthly article:Today almost everyone seems to assume that the critical moment in young people\u2019s lives is finding out which colleges have accepted them. \u2026  But what if \u2026 it turns out that going to the \u201chighest ranked\u201d school hardly matters at all? \u2026 Krueger and Dale studied what happened to students who were accepted at an Ivy or a similar institution, but chose instead to attend a less sexy, \u201cmoderately selective\u201d school. It turned out that such students had, on average, the same income twenty years later as graduates of the elite colleges.Krueger also said something similar in the NYT in 2000:Our research found that earnings were unrelated to the selectivity of the college that students had attended among those who had comparable options. \u2026 One group of students, however, clearly benefited from attending a highly selective college: those from lower-income families.All pretty consistent right?  At this point you might think you needn\u2019t dig deeper.  But in 2000 Krueger went on to say:Although the selectivity of a school does not appear to influence the typical student\u2019s economic success, our analysis finds that the resources schools devote to instruction, which are related to tuition costs, do influence it.In fact his original 1998 working-paper abstract said:We find that students who attended colleges with higher average SAT scores do not earn more than other students who were accepted and rejected by comparable schools but attended a college with a lower average SAT score.  However the Barron\u2019s rating of school selectivity and the tuition charged by the school are significantly related to the students\u2019 subsequent earnings.Half Sigma screams from the rooftops:Based on the straightforward regression results in column 1, men who attend the most competitive colleges [according to Barron\u2019s 1982 ratings] earn 23 percent more than men who attend very competitive colleges, other variables in the equation being equal.23 percent is quite a bit of money, it\u2019s almost like getting two college degrees instead of one!  They also discovered that there was a benefit to attending a more expensive school. The more expensive tuition resulted in a lifetime internal rate of return of 20% for men and 25% for women.THE MOST MIS-CITED STUDY EVER?Whenever this study has been cited, it has always been for the exact opposite of its actual conclusion. \u2026 This demonstrates a persistent bias in which the media only reports what people want to hear instead of reporting the truth.Half Sigma notes Study Hacks agrees completely:I don\u2019t know why reporters sometimes seem so desperate to discount the value of wanting to attend a top college. \u2026 I get the impression \u2014 from the haughty tone of these articles \u2014 that it has more to do with the reporters thumbing their noses at what they deem to be annoying behavior by parents who live in their elite Manhattan or D.C. neighborhoods.That 2006 Atlantic Monthly article did go on to say:A study by Caroline Hoxby \u2026 suggests that graduates of elite schools do earn more than those of comparable ability who attended other colleges. Hoxby studied male students who entered college in 1982, and \u2026 projected that among students of similar aptitude, those who attended the most selective colleges would earn an average of $2.9 million during their careers; those who attended the next most selective colleges would earn $2.8 million; and those who attended all other colleges would average $2.5 million.Ack!  I was almost conned by elite journal editors and media reporters into believing a comforting lie!  What saved me was becoming puzzled by actually reading the original paper, and then bloggers I found via web searches to resolve my confusion.  Thank you Half Sigma, who has more valuable results to convey:STUDENTS WITH HIGHER SAT SCORES EARN LESS MONEYThe regression analysis in the Dale & Krueger study had a coefficient for the person\u2019s SAT score and a second for the square of the SAT score. Based on these two coefficients, earnings peaks at an SAT score of 1100. People who have an SAT score higher than 1100 earn less money.I would find it hard to believe if I hadn\u2019t discovered the same thing myself. \u2026ATHLETES EARN MORE MONEYThe Dale & Krueger regression analysis also included a variable indicating if the person was an athlete. Those who were athletes earned more money. This also confirms my own findings from the General Social Survey.Added 24Mar: Good discussions at Marginal Revolution, Hacker News, and Org Theory.","101":" A Tale Of Two Tradeoffs  The design of social minds involves two key tradeoffs, which interact in an important way.The first tradeoff is that social minds must both make good decisions, and present good images to others.  Our thoughts influence both our actions and what others think of us.  It would be expensive to maintain two separate minds for these two purposes, and even then we would have to maintain enough consistency to convince outsiders a good-image mind was in control. It is cheaper and simpler to just have one integrated mind whose thoughts are a compromise between these two ends.When possible, mind designers should want to adjust this decision-image tradeoff by context, depending on the relative importance of decisions versus images in each context.  But it might be hard to find cheap effective heuristics saying when images or decisions matter more.The second key tradeoff is that minds must often think about the same sorts of things using different amounts of detail.  Detailed representations tend to give more insight, but require more mental resources.  In contrast, sparse representations require fewer resources, and make it easier to abstractly compare things to each other.  For example, when reasoning about a room a photo takes more work to study but allows more attention to detail; a word description contains less info but can be processed more quickly, and allows more comparisons to similar rooms.It makes sense to have your mental models use more detail when what they model is closer to you in space and time, and closer to you in your social world; such things tend to be more important to you.  It also makes sense to use more detail for real events over hypothetical ones, for high over low probability events, for trend deviations over trend following, and for thinking about how to do something over why to do it.  So it makes sense to use detail thinking for \"near\", and sparse thinking for \"far\", in these ways. It can make sense to have specialized mental systems for these different approaches, i.e., systems best at reasoning from detailed representations, versus systems best at reasoning from sparse abstractions.  When something became important enough to think about at all you would first use sparse systems, graduating to detail systems when that thing became important enough to justify the added resources.  Even then you might continue to reason about it using sparse systems, at least if you could sufficiently coordinate the two kinds of systems.A non-social mind, caring only about good personal decisions, would want consistency between near and far thoughts.  To be consistent, estimates made by sparse approaches should equal the average of estimates made when both sparse and detail approaches contribute.  A social mind would also want such consistency when sparse and detail tasks had the same tradeoffs between decisions and images.  But when these tradeoffs differ, inconsistency can be more attractive. The important interaction between these two key tradeoffs is this: near versus far seems to correlate reasonably well with when good decisions matter more, relative to good images.  Decision consequences matter less for hypothetical, fictional, and low probability events.  Social image matters more, relative to decision consequences, for opinions about what I should do in the distant future, or for what they or \"we\" should do now.  Others care more about my basic goals than about how exactly I achieve them, and they care especially about my attitudes toward those people.  Also, widely shared topics are better places to demonstrate mental abilities.Thus a good cheap heuristic seems to be that image matters more for \"far\" thoughts, relative to decisions mattering more for \"near\" thoughts.  And so it makes sense for social minds to allow inconsistencies between near and far thinking systems.  Instead of having both systems produce the same average estimates, it can make sense for sparse estimates to better achieve a good image, while detail estimates better achieve good decisions. And this seems to be just what the human mind does.  The human mind seems to have different \"near\" and \"far\" mental systems, apparently implemented in distinct brain regions, for detail versus abstract reasoning.  Activating one of these systems on a topic for any reason makes other activations of that system on that topic more likely; all near thinking tends to evoke other near thinking, while all far thinking tends to evoke other far thinking. These different human mental systems tend to be inconsistent in giving systematically different estimates to the same questions, and these inconsistencies seem too strong and patterned to be all accidental.  Our concrete day-to-day decisions rely more on near thinking, while our professed basic values and social opinions, especially regarding fiction, rely more on far thinking.  Near thinking better helps us work out complex details of how to actually get things done, while far thinking better presents our identity and values to others.  Of course we aren't very aware of this hypocrisy, as that would undermine its purpose; so we habitually assume near and far thoughts are more consistent than they are. These near-far inconsistencies seems to me to reasonably explain puzzles like:we value particular foreign-born associates, but oppose foreign immigrationwe say we want to lose weight, but actually don't exercise more or eat lesswe say we care about distant future folk, but don't save money for themSo which of near or far thinking is our \"true\" thinking?  Perhaps neither; perhaps we really contain an essential contradiction, which we don't want to admit, much less resolve.Added:  The key puzzle I'm trying to address here is the fact that hypocrisy is hard.  It is hard enough to manage a mind with coherent opinions across a wide range of topics.  To manage two coherent systems of opinions, one for decisions and one for image, and then only let them differ where others can't see, that seems really hard.  I'm saying the near-far brain division can be handy when facing this problem; let the far system focus more on image, and the near system focus more on decisions.","102":" Pick One: Sick Kids or Look Poor  Katja is on a roll:SODIS is a cheap method of disinfecting water by putting it in the sun. Like many things, it works better in physics than society, where its effects were not significant, according to a study in PLoS medicine recently\u2026. [In] Rural Bolivia, where the study was done \u2026 the children studied usually get diarrhoea four times a year, which causes about fifteen percent of deaths of children under five. For the poorest quintile in Bolivia the under five death rate is about one in ten of those born alive. \u2026 The leader of the study, Daniel Mausezahl, suspects a big reason for this is that lining up water bottles on your roof shows your neighbors that you aren\u2019t rich enough to have more expensive methods of disinfecting water. \u2026Fascinating as signaling explanations are, this seems incredible. \u2026 Perhaps adults are skeptical about effectiveness?  There is apparently good evidence it works though, and there were intensive promotional campaigns during the study. What\u2019s more lack of evidence doesn\u2019t usually stop humans investing in just about anything [medical] that isn\u2019t obviously lethal. \u2026.

When are parents ever willing to make themselves appear poor or low status to reduce their kid\u2019s chance of dying by 1.5%?","103":" What Is Em \u201cDeath\u201d?  Yesterday I talked about one big change with ems (future whole  brain emulation robots) \u2013 they\u2019d mostly be workaholics. Another other big change with ems, I think, is their concept of and attitude toward \u201cdeath.\u201d Ems would often agree to make copies of themselves, copies which they expected would only last for a limited time, such as one year. But they\u2019d mostly be fine with this. Let me explain.Imagine that you have lost all memories of some period of your life, say a period one year long. You still have pictures, letters, a diary, some video, memories in others you can talk to, etc. But while it all sounds like the sort of thing you might have done, you don\u2019t additionally recall doing any of it. How much would this memory loss degrade the value of your overall life? I\u2019d say it would be far worse to have not lived that year at all, say being put in suspended animation, than to merely have lost the memory of that year.Now imagine that, because you had access to a time machine, this lost year happened at the same time as one of your other years. During 2006, for example, you were off experiencing 2005 all over again, but in another place, and then you forgot it all, expect for the pictures, etc. For me, this would not much degrade the overall value of my life. It would again be a bit sad not to remember that year, but its not a big deal when it happened.Now imagine that you could use this time machine to both experience 2005 twice, forgetting one of the parts, and also to experience 2006 as usual. Here you\u2019d be adding one more year onto your life, which I\u2019d consider great. If the cost of having one more year of life were that you don\u2019t fully remember that year, to me that would be a small price to pay.For an em who shared my attitudes here, the option to spawn a new copy who only lasted a year would be much like the option to live another year longer, but without remembering it. Mostly a good deal, at least if you liked your life during that time. Yes the copy might be sad when his year came to an end, knowing his detailed memories of that year would not last. But he\u2019d usually expect that \u201che\u201d would continue to exist through other copies. He wouldn\u2019t consider this harm to be remotely as large as what we call \u201cdeath\u201d \u2014 the end of anyone who remembers our life in some detail.Ems would start as scans of humans, but not of random humans \u2013 the humans would be chose for their productivity and their acceptance of the em patterns of life, and \u201cdeath.\u201d As a result, ems would mostly be fantastically-capable workaholics who were not greatly bothered by \u201cdeath\u201d given the existence of other close copies.

These costs include prevention efforts, opportunity costs, and risks to life and health. The annual social loss is estimated at $2.9T, comparable to the $2.7T we spend on food and shelter, the $3.8T on medicine, and a significant fraction of our $21T GDP. One of the biggest contributions is $1.1T from 104K lives lost in 2018 at $10.6M each, including $0.7T from 67K drug overdoses deaths.But such drug deaths have been roughly doubling every decade since 1980, and in the year up to April 2021, there were 100K US drug overdose deaths, making that loss by itself $1T, at least if you accepted a $10M per life estimate, which I do think is too high. Even so, drug overdose deaths are clearly a huge problem, worth thinking about. What can we do?Reading up on the topic, I see a lot of conflicting theories on what would work best. But a big part of the problem seems to me to be that it isn\u2019t clear who exactly owns this problem. We might see it as a family problem, an employer problem, a medical problem, or a legal problem. Yet each of those groups resists taking responsibility, and we don\u2019t fully empower any of them to deal well with the problem.Now I\u2019m no expert on drug overdosing, bit I do fancy myself a bit of an expert on getting organizations to own problems. So let me try my hand at that.I\u2019ve previously suggested that people choose health agents, who pay for and choose medicine but who lose lots of money if their clients become disabled, in pain, or die. I\u2019ve also suggested that people choose crime vouchers, who must pay for cash fines when their clients are found guilty of crimes, but who have client-voucher contracts able to set client co-liability and to choose punishments and freedoms of association, movement, and privacy. I\u2019ve also suggested having agents who insure you against hard times, career agents who get some fraction of your future income, and that parents get such a fraction to compensate for raising you.So as a man with all these hammers staring at this tough nail of drug overdoses, I\u2019m tempted to merge them into one big hammer and take a swing. That is, how would a merged agent who had all these incentives try to deal with a potential drug problem?Imagine a for-profit experienced expert org approved by the client\u2019s parents when they are a kid, or by the client when they are adult. In a world with with few legal constraints on the contracts that this agent can agree to with clients. An org who probably also represents many of this client\u2019s friends and family. An org who gains from client income, but who must pay when a client is found guilty of a crime, or suffers hard times, pain, disability, or death. An org able to limit client freedoms of privacy, movement, and association, And able to set client punishments for verified events, and to make associated clients co-liable, so that they are all punished together re events involving any one of them.Such an agent might make sure to get addicts a reliable drug supply, or to have overdose drugs readily available. Or they might forbid clients from mixing with drug types. Or they might test clients regularly, or encourage althetics that conflict with drug use. Or any of a thousand other possible approaches. The whole point is that I don\u2019t have to figure that out; it would be their job to figure out what works.Now if an org with incentives and powers like that can\u2019t find a way to get clients to avoid becoming drug addicts, or to not overdose if they do, then that would probably either be due to some larger social context that they couldn\u2019t change, or because many individuals just like drugs so much that they are willing to take substantial chances of overdosing.What if a larger social policy related to drugs or users was a key problem? For example, maybe drug laws are too strict, or too lax. If so, I\u2019d expect these orgs to figure out which and lobby for changes. And given their expertise and incentives, I\u2019d be tempted to listen to them. If you didn\u2019t trust them so much, well then you might consider using futarchy to choose. But honestly I expect such combined agents could handle the problem regardless of larger policies.In sum, I suggest that the key underlying problem with drug overdoses is that no expert org owns the problem, by being approved by clients yet given clear abilities and incentives to solve the problem. Yes this is a big ask, and this is my generic solution to many problems. Doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work.","105":" This Isn\u2019t News  To those with a good basic econ education, it isn\u2019t news that the world economy continues to grow.  Nevertheless, it is worth remembering and repeating from time to time.  Tyler Cowen:It may not feel that way right now, but the last 10 years may go down in world history as a big success. \u2026 Steady economic growth is an underreported news story \u2014 and to our own detriment. As human beings, we are prone to focus on very dramatic, visible events, such as confrontations with political enemies or the personal qualities of leaders, whether good or bad. We turn information about politics and economics into stories of good guys versus bad guys and identify progress with the triumph of the good guys. In the process, it\u2019s easy to neglect the underlying forces that improve life in small, hard-to-observe ways, culminating in important changes.","106":" Jones, Beckstead, & I  Nick Beckstead talked with Garett Jones and I on long run consequences of growth. One point is worth emphasizing: if long run growth matters more than today\u2019s suffering, directly helping those suffering today is unlikely to be the best strategy. From Beckstead\u2019s summary:What are the long-run consequences of helping people in the developing world, e.g. through donating to GiveDirectly?If the argument for doing this is that it helps with long-run growth, it\u2019s implausible. It seems very unlikely that donations to GiveDirectly are the best way to speed up economic growth. Improvements in the institutions that hold back innovation would seem more plausible.Programs like GiveDirectly may have some indirect effects on governance, which could in turn haveeffects on long-run growth. For example, people who are suffering less because they are less poor might vote better. We should not assume, in general, that any way of helping people has [predictable] long-run consequences on growth. \u2026 [Also,] sending resources from high-growth nations to low-growth nations would be bad for long-term growth.

Like another Oscar contender, True Grit, it is the story of a teen girl\u2019s gritty struggle. Except that the world of Winter\u2019s Bone is rural and low class. A colleague\u2019s wife confessed to me that she was so horrified and repulsed by the world depicted as to make her reluctant to venture out of the city. While most folks in our society pride themselves on their respect for other cultures and ethnicities, such folk have little reason to fear being mistaken for someone from most such cultures. Their respect extends the least to \u201cwhite trash,\u201d who they have the most reason to fear being confused with.Words like seamy, sleezy, and seedy are negatives vaguely associated with sloppiness, immorality, and low class, as if to imply that such things naturally go together. Which seems to me the worst sort of vague insinuation. I can accept that low class folks tend to be sloppier, and in some folk\u2019s morality that in itself makes them less moral. But while I\u2019m happy to celebrate our new better top class, if we are talking about an economists\u2019 sort of immorality, i.e., hurting other folks on net, it isn\u2019t clear to me that low class folks are less moral. They contribute a larger fraction of income to charity, if I recall. I can see you might be terrified of associating with them if you feared being confused with them, but I can\u2019t sympathize much with that, as your desire to keep your status high comes at the expense of keeping the status of others low. I don\u2019t see great cause to fear more direct harms.","108":" A Model of Extraordinary Claims  Last week I claimed that the saying \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" is appropriate anytime people too easily make more extreme claims than their evidence can justify.  Eliezer, however, whom I respect, thought the saying appropriate anytime people make claims with a very low prior probability.  So I have worked out a concrete math model to explore our dispute.  I suggest that if you are math averse you stop reading this post now. Consider the example of power law disasters, where the chance of an event with severity greater than x goes as a negative power x^-v.  If we talk in terms of the magnitude y = log(x) of the disaster, then our prior on y is distributed exponentially as exp(-v*y).Imagine that a claimer gets a signal s about our next disaster magnitude y, a signal normally distributed with mean y and standard deviation d.  His maximum posterior estimate (MPE) of y should rationally be z = s \u2013 d*v, and his posterior for y should be normally distributed with mean z and standard deviation d.   The claimer will claim to us either that his signal was s\u2019, or equivalently that his MPE was z\u2019.   We must then decide what to believe about the distribution of y (or x) from this claim.Let us assume that the payoff U of this claimer is the sum of two parts: attention U1 and truth U2.  First, he gets an attention payoff U1 that goes as a*z\u2019, rewarding him more for claiming that a bigger disaster looms.  Second, he gets a truth payoff U2 that is a logarithmic proper scoring rule.  That is, he must declare a probability distribution p(y) and will be paid as log(p(y)), using the chance he assigned to the actual disaster magnitude y that occurs.  (So U = a*z(s\u2019) + Int_y p(y|s) log(p(y|s\u2019)) dy.)Let us also assume that the claimer is not an exact rational agent; the chance he makes any claim z\u2019 (or s\u2019) is exponential in his total payoff, as in exp(r*U), where r is his rationality.  Finally, assume that we know parameters like a,d,r,v, and that the claimer\u2019s signal s is well away from the lower boundary of possible y, so we can treat integrals over normal distributions as if they went to infinity. Putting this all together and turning the crank, we find that a claimer with zero attention payoff will claim a z\u2019 that is normally distributed with a mean of the infinitely rational z (or equivalently a s\u2019 that is normally distributed around a mean of the actual s).  The standard deviation c of this distribution depends on his rationality r and the strength of his payoffs U.  For a claimer with a positive attention payoff, his z\u2019 (or s\u2019) is also normally distributed with the same standard deviation c, but the mean of this distribution is biased toward larger disasters, with a bias b that is proportional to a. When we hear the claimer\u2019s claim z\u2019 (or s\u2019), we make an inference about y.  Our rational posterior for y should have a mean z = z\u2019-b-c*v and a standard deviation c, which depends on both d and r.   That is, we are skeptical about the claim for two reasons.  First, we correct for the bias b due to the claimer distorting his claims to gain more attention.   Second, we correct for the fact that larger disasters are a priori less likely, a correction that rises as the claimer\u2019s rationality falls.So this model contains effects similar to those Eliezer and I were discussing.  My claim was that in practice the attention payoff effect is larger than the irrational claimer effect, but I have not shown that yet.  Note, however, that the correction, and the relative size of the two effects, does not depend on how a priori unlikely is the claim z\u2019.","109":" Yay Parliaments  Voters may like the idea of direct democracy, but as Garett Jones mentions in 10% Less Democracy, most scholars agree that representative democracy produces better outcomes. Similarly, while voters may thrill more to directly choose their top leader, better outcomes come from having voters pick legislators who then pick, and can remove, the top leader.Here\u2019s Arend Lijphart with some simple theory:In parliamentary systems, only the legislature is popularly elected and is the clear and legitimate representative of the people, but in presidential systems both president and legislature are popularly elected and are both legitimate representatives of the people\u2014but it is quite possible and even likely that the president and the majority of legislators have divergent political preferences. \u2026 There is no democratic principle to resolve such disagreements. \u2026 second problem is \u201crigidity\u201d: presidents are elected for fixed periods of time. \u2026 third serious problem is the \u201cwinner take all\u201d nature of presidential elections. \u2026 The fourth serious drawback of presidentialism is that presidential election campaigns encourage the politics of personality \u2026 instead of \u2026 competing parties and \u2026 programs.In his new book Why Not Parliamentarism? Tiago Ribeiro Dos Santos collects much evidence favoring that option:The main theme is executive subordination to parliament. However, there is no \u201ccutoff\u201d point that makes a country definitely presidential or definitely parliamentary. \u2026In this book, I argue that parliamentary systems are vastly superior to presidential systems. The word \u201csuperior\u201d is deliberately chosen because parliamentary systems outperform presidential ones in just about any aspect worth pursuing by a respectable and universal ethical philosophy. Not only are they more efficient and more protective of individual liberties, but they are also more equal. Parliamentary systems are more stable, are less prone to coups, and are also more adaptable and incorporate changes quicker than presidential systems. They preserve traditions yet also innovate, and they grow faster and better protect the environment.The evidence he collects is diverse, and for me persuasive. First there are raw correlations:The number of parliamentary countries is [now] very close to the number of presidential countries. \u2026 [In] a ranking of countries by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, \u2026 top 30 countries include oil-rich countries, 2 presidential countries (the US and South Korea), and no less than 22 parliamentary countries. .. [Re the] Sustainable Development Goals, [top 17 are all parliamentary, none of bottom 20 are] \u2026 [Re] UN Development Program\u2019s Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index, \u2026 only 2 of the top 30 countries are presidential, and none of the them are in the top 20. \u2026Then there is history:We have failed to understand much of [old] European political thought \u2026 We read authors such as Edmund Burke, Benjamin Constant, Germaine de Sta\u00ebl, Fran\u00e7ois Guizot, Alexis de Tocqueville, and John Stuart Mill. \u2026 [but] have forgotten the concrete, overarching project in which these figures all were involved, the one that made their thought intelligible. That project was parliamentarism. For each of [these] authors, \u2026 the defining feature of a free state was that it contained a space for parliamentary politics\u2014an assembly in which political actions were discussed and deliberated and in which executive officials were held responsible. \u2026The phenomenon of the parliamentarization of Europe easily escapes many analysts because it was a gradual process and is often confused with democratization. \u2026 When the proper terms are used, parliamentarization for the expansion of parliamentary powers and democratization for the expansion of suffrage, it becomes clear that the first term is associated with general institutional improvements, while the latter does not have as much evidence in favor of [its value]. So European countries were the first to industrialize and were the first to become parliamentary. \u2026 In both a global and regional level, the first countries to adopt parliamentary systems did better earlier.There is stat analysis of recent national experiences:The study of presidential systems is teeming with confusion because the most studied presidential system, the US, is very atypical. Presidential powers in the US are severely more limited than in other presidential countries. \u2026Propensity for lower government spending in presidential systems. \u2026 find significant differences in favor of parliamentarism in 10 of the 14 outcome measures, with presidential systems not superior in any of them. Namely, parliamentary systems are associated with higher GDP per capita, better corruption control, bureaucratic quality, rule of law, telephone mainlines, import duties, trade openness, investment rating, infant mortality, and literacy. \u2026 In sum, despite not being unanimous, the state of the evidence points to a clear advantage of parliamentary systems.There is the history of how competitive firms are organized:Companies organized as presidential systems do not seem to exist [today]; all of them follow a logic similar to the parliamentary system, where shareholders elect a board of directors (the parliament) who hires and fires the CEO (the prime minister). \u2026 Unlike national governments, companies were able to experiment with a much wider range of constitutional arrangements, and experiment they did. In FPT\u2019s database of companies before 1850, unincorporated companies had extreme freedom to select a variety of governance arrangements. [Freedom they often used.]Finally, and to me most persuasive, there is evidence on U.S. cities:Since the beginning of the 20th century, cities can\u2014and increasingly have\u2014adopted the \u201ccouncil\u2013manager\u201d model of government, whereby citizens elect a council, which in turn is responsible for choosing a city manager in charge of administration. This model stands in contrast with cities that adopt the \u201cstrong mayor\u201d model, where citizens elect the mayor and council separately and the mayor is largely responsible for administration. \u2026For every objective measure that could be investigated, the results were either in favor of the council\u2013manager model or a difference could not be found. \u2026 The only people who seem to evaluate mayors better than managers are mayors the selves, which is perhaps not surprising. \u2026 managers reduce spending in police forces without losing quality. \u2026 less wasteful tax exemptions in manager cities, \u2026 treasurers appointed by the council, as opposed to elected, borrow at lower rates. \u2026 \u201ccouncil\u2013manager cities have stronger budgetary solvency compared with mayor\u2013council cities,\u201d \u2026 council\u2013manager cities have less corruption.As usual, the studies of variation across nations have a small N problem; if you try to include too many controls, you run out of data. In contrast, for firms N is huge, but one worries that their problems are too different, as boards of directors are rarely elected directly by shareholders. But the problem of city governmence seems close enough to nations, and there N is large. For example, in this study N = 12,238. And even that N is just barely enough to clearly show this:switches to mayor-council (council-manager) form are associated with a reduction (increase) in spending of just over 9 percent, relative to jurisdictions with no change in government form in that year.As reviews of this city governance literature seem consistently favor managers over mayors, that cinches it for me.I\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the years considering far more radical governance proposals. So the very slow trend toward adopting parliamentary systems seems quite discouraging. While I see enormous emotional energy around me devoted to politics, almost none of it tries to push for better overall systems for which the data is quite solid. What hope can there be for more radical but sensible change?There is an Inter-parliamentary Union (IPU), but the richest country in the world, the US, is not even a member. The approved budget of the IPU for 2020 is around US$18 million. A sign of hope is that the UN adopted a resolution in 2018, establishing a partnership with the IPU and creating the International Day of Parliamentarism, celebrated for the first time on June 30, 2018.I plan to celebrate that next year.Added 7p: The author tweets re the growth advantage of parliaments:That\u2019s a good point. If I had to choose, I would go for McManus and Ozkan\u2019s estimate of a 0.6 to 1.2pp higher yearly growth. I believe this is conservative because of attenuation bias I mention.\u2014 Tiago Santos (@tribsantos) September 28, 2020","110":" Why We Like Middle Options, Small Menus  Many say that consumers are biased to prefer the middle of three options, and to buy less when offered more options.  In the latest American Economic Review, Emir Kamenica shows these need not be biases: Numerous studies demonstrate that seemingly irrelevant factors influence people's decisions. \u2026 when three alternatives are available, the middle alternative is chosen more often than when it is paired with only one other option. \u2026 In choice overload experiments, customers are less likely to make a purchase if more products are added to the choice set. \u2026In this paper, I develop a model where uninformed consumers learn payoff-relevant information by observing what goods are available. The tendency to select the middle option thus naturally arises when there are consumers who are unsure which option is best for them, but know their tastes are middlebrow. Choice overload comes as no surprise if excessive product lines reduce consumers' information about which varieties are likely to suit them. \u2026The idea is straightforward: in a market setting, a consumer's knowledge of her relative position in the distribution of tastes is sufficient for identifying the optimal good if she can observe the entire product line. When fixed costs exclude some goods from the product line, however, the reduced menu provides worse information and forces the consumer to choose based on her prior. This leads to an inconsistency between choices from a smaller and a larger menu. \u2026When many consumers are uninformed, the firm may try to manipulate consumers' beliefs through the set of varieties it offers. In particular, I establish that the firm may introduce premium loss leaders \u2013 expensive goods of overly high quality which, though unprofitable on their own, greatly improve the demand for other goods. \u2026An uninformed consumer can be better off with a smaller choice set. The logic behind this possibility is as follows. A consumer who does not know which variety she likes must choose randomly among the available varieties. In equilibrium, the most popular varieties are introduced, so the average popularity of the available varieties is decreasing in the breadth of the product line. Consequently, the uninformed consumer's expected surplus is greater when there are fewer options.I expect this actually does explain a lot of this sort of consumer behavior. Choice sets really do typically contain info that we quite reasonably notice. Kamenica's other papers are interesting too, including these speed dating results:Women put greater weight on the intelligence and the race of partner, while men respond more to physical attractiveness. Moreover, men do not value women's intelligence or ambition when it exceeds their own. Also, we find that women exhibit a preference for men who grew up in affluent neighborhoods. Finally, male selectivity is invariant to group size, while female selectivity is strongly increasing in group size.","111":" Longevity Film Trailer  Apparently documentary films are often funded in chunks; they make part of it, put together a trailer to show around, and then get more money to finish it. I\u2019m included in this part-way-through trailer for David Alvarado\u2019s slick-looking new film on longevity:Though the trailer is 2D, much of it was actually filmed in 3D, including a wide ranging lunch discussion with myself and my GMU colleagues. Hope that makes it into a final version.","112":" The Up Side Of Down  In her new book, The Up Side of Down: Why Failing Well Is the Key to Success, Megan McArdle takes some time to discuss forager vs. farmer attitudes toward risk.Forager food sources tended to be more risky and variable, while farmer food sources are more reliable. So foragers emphasized food sharing more, and a tolerate attitude toward failure to find food. In contrast, farmers shared food less and held individuals responsible more for getting their food. We\u2019ve even seen the same people switch from one attitude to the other as they switched from foraging to farming. Today some people and places tend more toward farmer values of strict personal responsibility, while other people and places tend more toward forager forgiveness.McArdle\u2019s book is interesting throughout. For example, she talks about how felons on parole are dealt with much better via frequent reliable small punishments, relative to infrequent random big punishments. But when it comes to bankruptcy law, a situation where the law can\u2019t help but wait a long time to respond to an accumulation of small failures, McArdle favors forager forgiveness. She points out that this tends to encourage folks who start new businesses, which encourages more innovation. And this does indeed seem to be a good thing.Folks who start new businesses are pretty rare, however, and it is less obvious to me that more leniency is good overall. It is not obvious that ordinary people today face more risk than did most farmers during the farming era. The US apparently has the most lenient bankruptcy law in the world, and that is indeed some evidence for its value. However, it seems to me more likely that US forager forgiveness was caused by US wealth than vice versa. McArdle says the US got lenient bankruptcy in the late 1800s via lobbying by senators representing western farmers in debt to eastern banks. And it is even harder to see how farming in the US west then was more risky than has been farming throughout the whole farming era.Most likely what changed was the wealth of US farmers, and their new uppity attitudes toward rich elites. This fits with debt-forgiveness being a common liberal theme, which fits with liberal attitudes being more forager-like, and becoming more common as rising wealth cut the fear that made farmers. If lenient bankrupts is actually better for growth in our world, this would be another example of Caplan\u2019s idea trap, where rising wealth happens to create better attitudes toward good policy.Overall I found it very hard to disagree with anything that McArdle said in her book. If you know me, that is quite some praise.Added 2May: The fact that most farmer cultures were clannish may be part of an explanation here. The strict farmer morality is mostly about how to deal with outsiders, distant from your immediate family. The clan is punished severely, but it is usually more forgiving internally. If farmer clans had lower risk than do isolated families today, that could be a reason to have more forgiving bankruptcy law today.","113":" China Ascendant  A Post book review:\u201cWhen China Rules the World\u201d [is] a compelling and thought-provoking analysis of global trends that defies the common Western assumption that, to be fully modern, a nation must become democratic, financially transparent and legally accountable. Jacques argues persuasively that China is on track to take over as the world\u2019s dominant power and that, when it does, it will make the rules, on its own terms, with little regard for what came before.China is growing at a tremendous rate. Yet it refuses to follow the Western model of establishing genuine elections, an independent judiciary and a freely convertible currency. In fact, its restrictive currency rules have made China the world\u2019s leading creditor, while the United States sinks ever deeper into debt. And while the United States sacrifices the lives of its soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Chinese make money in both countries without losing a drop of blood.Yes!  The world has emulated Western policies mainly because those nations were high status, not because their style of law or government was obviously more efficient.  Chinese styles are likely similarly efficient, and if China becomes higher status, the world will emulate it instead. The book reviewer still can\u2019t quite believe:As a journalist who lived and breathed China for years, I felt sure that the Communist Party, following its loss of credibility at Tiananmen, would fall to ashes. During the boom of the 1990s, I knew that economic modernization would force Chinese institutions to become accountable and democratic. I was wrong again and again. My assumptions were out of date.  Still, one can\u2019t help wondering if China\u2019s trajectory, as unwavering as it may look now, may fizzle. Take, for instance, China\u2019s inability to accept or integrate outsiders \u2014 Jacques calls it \u201cthe Middle Kingdom mentality.\u201dWesterners pride themselves on their attitudes on diversity, and yes those may have some advantages.  But if so they are weak advantages, easily overwhelmed by other large Western disadvantages.  If China continues to outgrow the West, it will likely be because they do a few things very right, as did the West before. If China comes to dominate the world, it will likely then also overestimate how many of its peculiar styles give big efficiency gains.","114":" Status Drives Poverty?  A book on poor single moms, discussing why moms break up with guys:Conflicts over money do not usually erupt simply because the man cannot find a job or because he doesn\u2019t earn as much as someone with better skills or education.  Money usually becomes an issue because he seems unwilling to keep at a job for any length of time, usually because of issues related to respect.  Some of the jobs he can get don\u2019t pay enough to give him the self-respect he feels he needs, and others require him to get along with unpleasant customers and coworkers, and to maintain a submissive attitude toward the boss. (more; HT Bryan)I suspect much of what makes some cultures more successful than others is how they help folks to avoid seeing unpleasant interactions as direct challenges to their status.","115":" What is Gossip For?  It makes sense to listen to gossip in order to keep track of what folks are up to.  But it seems the main reason we listen to gossip is to prepare to speak gossip, in jockeying for status:We have consistently found that people are most interested in gossip about individuals of the same sex as themselves who happen to be around their own age. We have also found that information that is socially useful is always of greatest interest to us: we like to know about the scandals and misfortunes of our rivals and of high-status people because this information might be valuable in social competition. Positive information about such people tends to be uninteresting to us. Finding out that someone already higher in status than ourselves has just acquired something that puts that person even further ahead of us does not supply us with ammunition that we can use to gain ground on him. Conversely, positive information about our friends and relatives is very interesting and likely to be used to our advantage whenever possible. For example, in studies that my colleagues and I published in 2002 and in 2007 in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology, we consistently found that college students were not much interested in hearing about academic awards or a large inheritance if it involved one of their professors and that they were also not very interested in passing that news along to others. Yet the same information about their friends or romantic partners was rated as being quite interesting and likely to be spread around.I far prefer talking \"big ideas\" to gossiping, but I know that I am an outlier here, even relative to most academics. This once made me feel superior, but I now realize it puts me at a serious social disadvantage; when others see you don't gossip to monitor talk about you and to defend yourself and your allies, they feel freer to dis you and less inclined to ally with you.","116":" The Wisdom Of Others  When we choose to act on our own private clues, or to infer the clues of others from their actions, we too often neglect the wisdom of others:In situations where it is empirically optimal to follow others and contradict one\u2019s own information, the players err in the majority of cases, forgoing substantial parts of earnings. The average player contradicts her own signal only if the empirical odds ratio of the own signal being wrong, conditional on all available information, is larger than 2:1, rather than 1:1 as would be implied by rational expectations. \u2026 In total, the meta dataset contains 29,923 decisions made by 2,813 participants in 13 studies. All participants observe a private signal and a (possibly empty) string of previous choices made by others in analogous situations. In all decision problems there are two actions and two possible payoffs, but the dataset nevertheless comprises a large variety in environments, instructions, players\u2019 personal characteristics, and histories of other players\u2019 choices. (more)Of course copying others\u2019 acts sends a bad signal about our confidence in own own info and and analysis abilities. So it can make sense to focus more on one\u2019s own clues to the extent is is important to send a positive signal to observers.  Just beware of assuming too easily that such gains are substantial.","117":" Good With Bad Traits  Here\u2019s something odd to ponder: we generally think we are better than average, but tend to think we have particular personality traits that are less socially desirable. Two from the latest JPSP:The tendency for people to evaluate themselves more favorably than an average-peer\u2014the better-than-average effect (BTAE)\u2014is among the most well-documented effects in the social-psychological literature. The BTAE has been demonstrated in many populations with various methodologies. \u2026 For dimensions on which the self is positively evaluated, enhancement motives restrict the extent to which average-peer assimilation occurs. But for dimensions on which the self is negatively evaluated, enhancement motives amplify average-peer assimilation. (more)Consensus studies from 4 cultures\u2014in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Germany\u2014as well as secondary analyses \u2026 from 29 cultures suggest that there is a cross-culturally replicable pattern of difference between internal and external perspectives for the Big Five personality traits. People see themselves as more neurotic and open to experience compared to how they are seen by other people. External observers generally hold a higher opinion of an individual\u2019s conscientiousness than he or she does about him- or herself. As a rule, people think that they have more positive emotions and excitement seeking but much less assertiveness than it seems from the vantage point of an external observer. \u2026 A relatively strong negative correlation (r = \u2212.53) between the average self-minus-observer profile and social desirability ratings suggests that people in most studied cultures view themselves less favorably than they are perceived by others (more)","118":" Forage vs Farm Future  The two biggest events of last million years, by far, are the transition from foraging to farming and then from farming to industry. Since industry began, humans have changed in many ways, some of which are puzzling, since there hasn\u2019t been time for much genetic selection, and only limited time for cultural selection. Especially puzzling are big changes in our basic attitudes, and big variations in such attitudes between people and nations.The ten thousand years since the farming transition, however, offers more time for genetic and cultural adaptation. Yet ten thousand years is also short enough that we should expect much less than full adaptation. Some people and places should retain vestiges of forager ways, and variations in these vestiges should be important.So it seems natural to try to explain key variations and changes in attitudes today as vestiges of the transition from foragers to farmers colliding with the vast increase in individual wealth that is the main effect of industry. On Monday I described how foragers vs. farmers seems to do a decent job of capturing the rich-poor axis in the World Values Survey, which is related to today\u2019s liberal\/modern vs. conservative\/traditional political axis. I suggested that the social pressures which encouraged farming behaviors were naturally stronger for the poor, predicting that people retreat to forager ways with increasing industry wealth. The rest of the week I explored two theories of why such social pressures reduce with wealth.Today I want to consider what this theory implies about our future. First, it implies that if we continue to get richer, we should continue to see attitude changes in roughly the same directions. We should expect continued movement toward accepting school and workplace domination and ranking, and whatever other attitudes greatly enable industry to create wealth. And regarding how we spend our increased wealth, we should expect a continued shift from farmer to forager style attitudes for a while. For example, we should expect less war and physical cruelty to humans and animals, and more forager-like sexual promiscuity and respect for the environment. This should make us feel more happy, relaxed, and natural. In the extreme, we might even end up (for a time) as foragers in bands wandering virtual robot-supported forests, absent predators, famines, or pandemics.Yet in the long run, if our interactions remain competitive, we shouldn\u2019t expect forager behavior to be anything like the most adaptive for our descendants\u2019 future worlds. Neither should farming of course, but one might still wonder which offers the best basis for generating adaptation to those future worlds. And on that criteria, the farming style seem more promising. Its not so much that farming ways adapted to a larger social world, more like the large social worlds we expect for our descendants. Its more that farming adapted at all \u2013 farming found ways to push foragers, whose ways had been changing very slowly by farming standards, rather quickly into doing quite unnatural things. So farming meta-innovations, like religion, honor, politeness, etc., might well be usefully repurposed to get our descendants to adapt to even stranger future environments.For example, ems, or whole brain emulations, are my best guess for the next big transition on the order of the farming and industry transitions. Farmer-style stoicism, self-sacrifice, and self-control, detached as needed from farmer specifics like love of land or sexual monogamy, might well be more effective at creating acceptance of em-efficient lifestyles. Religious ems might, for example, better accept being deleted when new more efficient versions of themselves are introduced. \u201cOnward Christian robots\u201d might be the new sensibility. And em\u2019s low incomes might help farmer-style fear-based norm-enforcement to gain traction.Perhaps you hope that an industry-refashioned forager style might adapt just as well to these new requirements.  But wishing won\u2019t make it so.","119":" Prestige As Mob-Enforced Dominance  Humans distinguish two kinds of status, about which we are quite moralistic. There\u2019s the good kind, prestige, and the bad, dominance. These are commonly described as pro-social vs. selfish:Social status can be attained through either dominance (coercion and intimidation) or prestige (skill and respect). (more)As Machiavelli noted, love [prestige] and fear [dominance] are both valuable assets that can be used to influence others. (More)Dominance: Deference is demanded and is a property of the actor.Prestige: Deference is freely conferred and is a property of the beholder. \u2026 Creation of authentic and lasting relationships \u2026 High in need for affiliation; high in authentic pride. (more)Back in 2015, my co-author Kevin Simler argued for a \u201cmore cynical\u201d view:Central question [about prestige is] \u2026 What\u2019s in it for the admirer? I know of two answers \u2026 first is given by Joseph Henrich and Francisco Gil-White \u2026 second \u2026 by Amotz Zahavi \u2026 and \u2026 Jean-Louis Dessalles \u2026 This [second] account may be more cynical, perhaps, but it\u2019s one of the most powerful ideas I\u2019ve ever encountered.Henrich and Gil-White [say] \u2026 admiration \u2026 acts as a bribe. Admirers \u2026 are sycophants. \u2026 hoping to learn from their superiors. \u2026[But I say] prestige [is] \u2026 a kind of \u201ccredit\u201d reflecting the amount of good each [babbler bird] has done for others. \u2026 Prestige-seeking and admiration (deference) are complementary teaming instincts. They help babblers stay attached to a group, keep groupmates happy, and secure a larger share of the group\u2019s reproductive \u201cspoils.\u201d \u2026We [humans] voluntarily follow our leaders (and otherwise defer to them) because good things tend to happen when we do; it pays to be on their team. A leader who tries to command entirely with dominance \u2014 all stick, no carrot \u2014 will find his efforts thwarted at every turn \u2026 we want to be friends, allies, and teammates with people who do good things for their friends, allies, and teammates. [we] cultivate access to such people \u2026 by paying them respect and granting them the perks of prestige. \u2026Pinker \u2026 says, [prestige] is \u201cthe public knowledge that you possess assets that would allow you to help others if you wished to.\u201d \u2026 Among our ancestors, then, bullies quickly got their comeuppance \u2014 unless they offset their dominance with a lot of prestige, creating many friends and allies in the process. (More)But honestly, this view doesn\u2019t seem that cynical to me. As they say, \u201chold my beer\u201d. Consider my last post:Elite employers \u2026 focus overwhelmingly on prestige when picking junior employees. \u2026 don\u2019t that much care about your grades, what you\u2019ve learned, or what you did in your jobs or extracurriculars, as long as they were prestigious. \u2026 Even though you have been chosen for your very consistent lifetime pursuit of prestige, that is very much not allowed to be one of your main goals. \u2026 What they are mostly selling is a prestigious aura around [their] advice. \u2026 Customers who paid as much for less prestigious advice would probably also be punished, via others being less willing to praise or follow that advice. (More)Firms in this scenario aren\u2019t just \u201cfreely giving\u201d prestige, nor is this about learning, \u201clove\u201d, \u201cauthenticity\u201d, nor rewarding generous allies. These firms instead face strong incentives from audiences to assign prestige in the way that key audiences think prestige should be assigned.Consider academic \u201cpeer\u201d review. Reviewers formally decide who gets how much prestige. But if they gave good reviews \u201cfreely\u201d to whomever they most \u201cauthentically\u201d \u201cloved\u201d, they might not get invited to review again, and their own prestige may suffer. When you hope to gain prestige by hosting an academic conference, you will be punished if you don\u2019t invite the speakers that your key audiences think you should invite.Or consider \u201ccancelling\u201d, which is in effect a form of negative prestige. While I still have my job, many events and organizations tell me that they can\u2019t afford to publicly invite, fund, or associate with me because of what mobs say about me. They say they don\u2019t personally have a problem with anything I\u2019ve said or done, but they don\u2019t want the hassle that mobs could impose.In all these cases, we aren\u2019t at all looking at each person just \u201cfreely\u201d assigning to others the respect and evaluation that they privately think appropriate. Instead, evaluators face strong conformity pressures to agree with the evaluations of others.Both dominance and prestige are expressions of power. In dominance, the power is direct, what that person can do to or for you. But with prestige, the power is indirect, enforced via a local mob. You must \u201cfreely\u201d accord each person the respect that your relevant mob says is due, or risk their wrath. But make no mistake, there is a power that enforces prestige, just as with dominance.Note that \u201csocialists\u201d tend to explicitly frame unequal money or physical power as unacceptable \u201cdomination\u201d, and yet greatly admire historical cases where outraged and active mobs tried to fix such problems.Added 6Nov: Mercer & Sperber\u2019s Enigma of Reason similarly assumes that while those who present arguments might be biased, evaluators of arguments are neutral and fair.","120":" Natural Genocide  One of the worst crimes we can imagine is genocide \u2013 erasing an entire lineage from the universe forevermore.  Sadly, nature is so cruel that the usual ups and downs in lineage success mean genocide is the natural long-term result for most every lineage!  Let me explain.Lineages fluctuate on all scales.  Og falls off a cliff, while Ok does not.  A surprise attack wipes out half of a tribe.  A virus kills off half of those in connected community.  A drought kills off half of those in a region.  Or one lineage finds a mutation useful in the current environment while another does not. These usual ups and downs can be modeled via a \"lineage swap.\"  To swap a population, divide it into halves, pick one at random and delete a random half of it, replacing with copies of random selections from the other half.  When the total population size stays constant (and when the halves-lineage correlation has half the max effect) then after ten swaps the median outcome is for a lineage to contain about half as many individuals as before.  (The mean number is of course unchanged.)  So after one hundred swaps a lineage that started with one thousand individuals is probably extinct. For our hunter-gather ancestors (and our animal ancestors before that) this was clearly the usual outcome.  Even though the hunter-gatherer population doubled about every quarter million years, twenty five thousand years was plenty of time for the equivalent of several swaps.  Our farming ancestors had a better chance \u2013 for lineages whose swap rate was less than one per century, the overall population growth meant it could expect to survive indefinitely.   Since the introduction of industry the situation looks even better.  But more changes are yet to come, which raises the key future genocide question:  Will less than ten swap equivalents continue to happen on average in the time it takes the population to double?","121":"1 Presidential Decision Markets  We have had many prediction markets on who will be elected, but almost none on who should be elected.  So far, the only exceptions I know are decision markets on which nominees would most help their party gain the U.S. presidency.   Today, I\u2019m pleased to announce that Peter McCluskey has funded the creation of six now-live InTrade markets that should tell us how a Democratic versus Republican U.S. President will differently effect oil prices, long term interest rates, US government debt, and US troops in Iraq!  If enough people trade these assets, then for voters who know which direction they want these parameters to move, InTrade market prices could advise them on how to vote!Two different approaches will be tried on these four parameters.  Two parameters will use a binary shock response futures approach, with one asset each paying based on whether, over the course of election day, oil prices or T-bond interest rates move in the same direction as the probability of a Democrat winner. For example, if you think (speculators think) that a Democrat is more likely to raise oil prices than a non-Democrat, you should be willing to pay more than 50 for the asset that pays 100 if these two move in the same direction.  You can cash in these assets a few days after the election. For the two other parameters, four assets will support simple conditional estimates.  Each parameter will have Democrat, Non-Democrat asset pairs.  The Democrat asset in the pair pays only if a Democrat is the next president, while the other asset only pays otherwise.  Bundling each pair together gives assets whose prices estimate:The probability US Govt debt will rise from FY 2010 to 2011 (assets: D, ND).The number of US troops in Iraq mid 2010 (assets: D, ND).Dividing the price of each individual asset by market chances of a Democrat president (or not) produces estimates of these parameters conditional on a Democrat president (or not).  The difference between the Democrat and the other conditional estimates say how much of a difference speculators expect a Democrat to make on that parameter.  You\u2019ll have to wait up to four years to cash in these assets. I see four key open questions:Can we get precise enough prices to see a Democrat versus not difference?Can we convince voters that such prices give reliable non-partisan estimates? Can we convince voters these prices show causal effects of the party in power?Can enough voters tell which way they\u2019d like these parameters to move for prices to be useful?  (I\u2019m not sure which ways I want.)Added: Peter has been told InTrade will waive all trading fees in these markets!","122":" Seeing Red  Seeing the color red apparently has large influences on our behavior.  Referees award more points to competitors wearing red, who win more competitions.  Test takers scored worse if their subject number was written in red, women wearing red are asked on dates more, and so on:\u201cThere is now good experimental evidence that red stimuli are perceived as dominant and that they cause negative effects on performance in those viewing them,\u201d Barton says. \u201cIt is plausible that wearing red also makes individuals feel more confident, although this hasn\u2019t yet been tested.\u201d \u2026  Mandrills, the world\u2019s largest species of monkey, use colour as a means of conflict management. In males, red faces, rumps and genitalia act as a status symbol, communicating fighting ability. \u201cThe brighter red a male is, the higher his testosterone level and the more aggressive he is,\u201d \u2026 Other primates use more subtle variations in facial redness to signal dominance. Rhesus monkeys, for example, become redder in the face in the mating season.Barton believes that red is involved in human behaviour in a similar way. \u201cSubtle variations in redness are conveying information about dominance, vigour and confidence. In an aggressive confrontation, confident individuals flush red with anger whereas frightened individuals go pale. \u2026 Even a brief glimpse of red can change human abilities and behaviour in all sorts of ways. \u2026 What consistently impresses researchers is the fact that their volunteers rarely suspect that colour plays an important, or indeed any, role in the outcome of an experiment. \u2026 \u201cGiven that the influence of colour on our behaviour is so prevalent, it\u2019s shocking that we aren\u2019t more aware of it.\u201dYes, shocking.  We have two main stories for this lack of awareness: accident and purpose.  Some suggest we shouldn\u2019t expect our conscious minds to know much about how our unconscious minds work, while others suggest an inquisitive and social species like humans could not long remain ignorant about something this important without substantial pressures discouraging such insight.This purpose story makes more sense to me.  I can see two pressures against insight here:We avoid seeing our own status moves, including reacting to red as a dominance marker.We identify ourselves as making decisions based on respectable criteria, which don\u2019t include red effects.","123":" Consulate Care  Here\u2019s another idea for medical reform: consulate care. Let countries like Sweden, France, etc. with approved national health care systems have bigger consulates, and open them up to paying customers for medical services. For example, you could sign up for Swedish Care, and when needed you\u2019d go to their consulate to get medical care as if you were living in Sweden.Now we might not approve consulate care for say North Korea or Uganda, but surely most developed nations are good enough. We don\u2019t issue travel warnings suggesting people not travel to Sweden, for fear of getting sick there. So why not let folks travel to a Sweden nearby for their medical care?Since most other nations spend far less than the US on medicine, consulate care should be a lot cheaper. And since those other nations seem to suffer no net health loss from their cheaper care, consulate care should be no less healthy.","124":" Professors Progress Like Ads Advise  A system designed to advise a captive audience about the features and quality of available products would look a lot more like Consumer Reports than the world of advertising we see.  But this situation isn\u2019t especially puzzling \u2013 we understand that neither those who make ads nor those who watch them have product information as their primary goal.   Ad makers want to sell, and ad watchers want to be entertained.   Observers often have trouble, however, understanding how academia could consistently fail to achieve useful intellectual progress.  Since academia is such a decentralized competitive system, people figure that any failures to make progress must be the unavoidable error that appears in any system designed to explore the unknown.  Since we can\u2019t know what we will discover until we discover it, complaints about progress are compared to second-guessing Monday-morning quarterbacks.   But in fact, academia is no more about making useful intellectual progress than advertising is about informing consumers.  Professors seek prestigious careers, while funders and students seek prestige by association.  Academics talk and write primarily to signal their impressive mental abilities, such as their mastery of words, math, machines, or vast detail.  Yes, contributing to useful intellectual progress can sometimes appear impressive, but the correlation is weak, and it is often hard to see who really contributed how much.   Progress happens, but largely as a side effect.   The astronomer Steinn Sigurosson observes:[Lee Smolin\u2019s] points on groupthink, and the systematic bias which discourages innovation and risk taking by young researchers hits painfully home \u2013 it is all too true, and yet it self-perpetuates because the mechanisms which reinforce conservatism in science are there for reasons. The system is flawed, and possibly broken, but the fix is not as simple as Smolin suggests \u2013 funding agencies are terrified of funding bad science, since there is so much pretty good science it is safe to fund, and as a community scientists are very harsh when bad science is mistakenly given precious resources.It is the same market flaw that gives us beautiful flawless large red apples in supermarkets \u2013 with no taste.To get the old intense flavour varieties that everyone loves when they taste, we would have to choose small bruised discoloured apples when we shop, and leave the flawless big red apples with no taste in the bins. But collectively we do not, and the market responds. All for the fear of being the one department head comsumer to go home with an occasional rotten apple.The real shame is that the big red shiny tasteless apples are rotten just as often, they just look so good sitting there, waxed and sprayed, in the bin.We will muddle through, progress will be made again, hordes of string theorists will be proven wrong, and some few of them may well be right, but no one will remember which.Science is self-correcting, which is its great strength, as long as we don\u2019t let the sociology do long term damage to the underlying scientific methodology. \u2018Course if you only get to buy one apple every three years you learn to be very conservative in your choice; don\u2019t want a rotten or even tart apple this decade.Consumers who choose pretty apples do not get especially tasty apples, and funders who choose impressive scientists do not especially promote progress.Hat tip to Not Even Wrong.","125":" The Insular Fertile Future  Fertility (= kids per adult) has been falling worldwide for centuries. It seems to be correlated strongly with societal (not individual) wealth, and mediated by norms transmitted via mass media. World elite culture supports falling fertility by celebrating professional more than parenting accomplishment. Among many rich world elites, fertility has fallen below replacement level, and is still falling further. More others should join them as the world gets richer and more culturally integrated.With seven billion humans today, if the population were to fall in half every two generations it would take roughly 1600 years for humanity to go extinct. So the risk isn\u2019t immediate, and lots of things might change before then. (E.g., see my book Age of Em.) But as this trend has been consistent for centuries, it\u2019s hardly crazy to think that it may continue for many more centuries.Yes, extinction isn\u2019t that likely, as a more likely scenario has selection stepping in to promote higher fertility. However, on reflection I think it also makes sense to worry about that better scenario, as the most likely way for selection to promote fertility is by promoting insular subcultures, especially re gender\/mating\/fertility. Let me explain.Today the cultures associated with higher fertility tend to be more \u201ctraditional\u201d, and less integrated with the dominant world elite culture. And a few small subcultures, like Mennonites and Amish, or Mormons and Orthodox Jews, even manage to maintain high fertility while staying closely connected to the dominant culture. However, as a big fraction of the youth of such subcultures leave them, it isn\u2019t obvious that these subcultures can long sustain net growth.But this does point to the plausibly winning strategy: subcultures that are both highly fertile and highly insular, keeping enough youth from wanting to defect from their subculture to join the dominant low fertility culture. Through some combination of genes, culture, and tech, they find a way isolate their members more from outside cultural influence, and thereby to support sustained population growth (or at least less rapid decline).That scenario is a win relative to human extinction, but it should worry those who see much value embodied in the dominant culture, and much harm that could come from more cultural isolation, or from the religions or ideologies that might be used to sustain such insularity. For example, as traditional cultures are the main source today of insular fertile cultures, they seem likely to also be the main source of such winning subcultures in a few centuries. Maybe we\u2019ll get a traditional culture who happens to take a lot from the dominant culture. But also maybe not.What other options do we have? We could hope that genetic evolution will turn out to be faster than we fear, that global culture will change its mind and switch to promoting fertility, or that cheap nurturing robot parents will appear in time. But these seem faint hopes. The dominant culture may well seek to repress divergent insular fertile subcultures, but that would raise the risk of human extinction.One possible fix that comes to mind here is for the dominant culture to tolerate and even encourage mating and gender variance among new cultural descendants of that dominant culture. That is, encourage the creation of new subcultures that inherit most of their cultural elements from the dominant culture, but that explore different approaches to mating, gender , and parenting within each subculture. Swinging, polyamory, and home schooling subcultures of today show that such cultural descendants are at least possible. Hopefully such subcultures would mainly be more culturally insular only regarding their mating, gender, and parenting aspects.With enough such experiments, we might find new subcultures that promote much higher fertility, and yet which also inherit many aspects of dominant culture. And these might have a fighting chance against insular subcultures descended from more traditional cultures. Alas, this fix requires that the dominant culture become much more tolerant of local variations in gender, mating, and parenting, which may not be much more likely than their just coming to see the wisdom of promoting fertility. After all we are currently in an increasingly Puritan era of more not less conformity on such things.I\u2019m afraid I really don\u2019t see a good solution here yet. But I at least want to flag the problem for consideration.","126":" Concept Artists  Back in \u201994 I won an electronic arts prize, and spent a weekend in Austria with artists. They had declared me a \u201cconcept artist\u201d and we discussed what that meant. I felt deja vu Thursday when I presented at the Parsons New School of Design, and after talked with professors of design and architecture (audio, slides; vid). It seems to me that they are also concept artists, though they might not embrace this description, and this made me wonder again how many intellectuals are concept artists.A painter arranges paint on a canvas in a pattern that other artists judge to be pretty or provocative or intriguing, or, well anything really that they respect enough to call \u201cart.\u201d While they have no explicit standards, they can roughly articulate many features that all-else-equal make paintings better, and communities of artists usually have enough consensus on what they like to together rate paintings as good or bad. It is similar for sculpture, movies, novels, etc. \u2014 communities of artists develop common enough implicit standards so that they agree enough on what is good art.Similar standards of evaluation can be applied to concepts, ideas, and claims. To the naive, \u201cconcept artists\u201d may sound like they intend mainly to make claims about reality, and to evaluate those claims in terms of how well they cohere with each other and data about reality. But in fact concept artists evaluate claims more the way most any artists evaluates art \u2013 in terms of beauty, elegance, provocation, intrigue, etc. This can make concept artists a bit more tolerant of ambiguity, logical gaps, etc., though the difference can be subtle \u2013 being too obviously tolerant of such things usually isn\u2019t good art.Concept artists aren\u2019t really my style of intellectual, but I must admit that the fact that conceptual artists are not primarily focused on the truth of their claims does not prevent them from achieving insight and contributing to intellectual progress.  Truth be old, most other intellectuals also are not first and foremost trying to find truth. Yet intellectual progress is often a side effect of their activities. It is much harder than you might think to say which intellectual styles best find truth in what contexts.","127":" One Book To Save Them  William Grassie has a fuzzy-headed far view on surviving catastrophe:Imagine a major planetary catastrophe, \u2026 something in the order of the Mt. Toba supervolcano \u2026 some 73,000 years ago. \u2026 Humanity was reduced to some 1000-to-10,000 breeding pairs. \u2026 One of the thirty or so supervolcanos \u2026 is the Yellowstone Basin. \u2026 The United States disappears in the course of a few days. \u2026 The survivors would be reduced to subsistence farming, gathering, hunting, and fishing in areas around the earth\u2019s equator. \u2026 Let\u2019s say that humanity is again reduced to some 10,000 breeding pairs. \u2026What knowledge from today would be most valuable to these survivors as they tried to rebuild their lives and repopulate the earth? \u2026 You get to choose one book. \u2026  Stockpiling food and weapons in the mountains of Idaho would be a silly and small-minded emergency plan. \u2026 Instead of focusing on the survival of my tribe, my family, or myself, we need to focus on the survival of civilization. \u2026.  And the only way to do this with assurance is to distribute the most valuable and practical knowledge as widely as possible across the planet today in anticipation that unfortunate day. \u2026The book I would chose is Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History. \u2026 It is the combined history of the universe, our creative planet, and our restless species. \u2026. Catastrophic collapses, however, are part of the big story. \u2026 Civilizations do not last forever. Farmlands become deleted. \u2026Most modern technology will be nonexistent. \u2026 Such technology will need to be reinvented, along with most of agriculture, medicine, engineering, economics, politics, art, music, morality, and religion. \u2026Curiously, most of us today, even among the best educated and most privileged, do not really know much about this incredible New Cosmology. \u2026 If future generations had the basic outline of this story \u2026 they would know where to focus their own intellect and creativity as they sought to rediscover and reinvent science, technology, agriculture and human culture. They could start looking for atoms, molecules, microbes, and cells, even if they lacked the tools to do so. \u2026 They would understand the motion of the sun, moon, and stars. \u2026 They would quickly rediscover and reinvent advanced mathematics. \u2026 They would understand the importance of energy density flows and creative innovation processes.It turns out that this Epic of Evolution may also be important information if we are to successfully meet the other challenges of the twenty-first century. The story includes insights into how nature functions as complex, distributed systems, and the dangers of run away environmental problems. It includes new insights about economics and how complex, distributed economic systems produce incredible wealth, as well as dangerous dysfunctions\u2026. It includes insights about the importance of limited governments and individual freedoms and responsibilities. \u2026 Our Common Story gives humanity new perspective, a vantage point, which takes the edge off bitter ideological, nationalist, and religious conflicts around the world.(HT James Hughes.)  This is amazingly wrong-headed:The reason to stockpile is not to save \u201cmy family\u201d but to ensure that our species survives at all.  A disaster that kills all but a thousand couples could nearly as easily have killed everyone.  Well-chosen stockpiles could easily make the difference between survival and extinction.You either preserve literacy or you don\u2019t.  A literate culture needs a lot more than one book to function.  Readers would quickly forget what the words in that one book meant unless those concepts were commonly used in many other books and in their lives.It would take a huge effort to maintain even a small literate subculture, that read regularly, and passed this habit on to thier kids.  This won\u2019t last unless some very practical advantages accrue to readers.  Impressing friends by quoting fascinating cosmology facts just won\u2019t do.Yes knowledge is key, but survivors would face an immediate need to know about how to survive as foragers.  It is far from easy to forage well, and without effective foraging they\u2019ll die.  If you want distribute copies of a book to ensure our species survives, it should a book on how to forage.  You might also pack those books with some simple foraging tools (like knives).How could Grassie get this so wrong?  His last paragraph quoted above is the tipoff.  Like most who talk about the future, he is far more interested in using future folk to set morality tales for today, than in ways to actually help them.  How else could  he imagine that a few ragged survivors desperate to avoid extinction should spend a big chunk of their time reminding themselves of just how glorious were we, their ancestors?","128":" Open Thread  Here is our monthly place to discuss issues not covered in our other posts.","129":" Doable Green  Since I recently said carbon emissions seemed a lost cause, let me emphasize that cap and trade fisheries are big, green, and feasible:Two years ago, a team of researchers took a broad look at the world\u2019s commercial fisheries and predicted that excessive harvesting would cause them all to collapse by 2048. Now, three other scientists have taken an equally broad look at how fisheries are managed and come up with a more hopeful view. \u2026[Researchers show] that stocks are much less likely to collapse if fishers own rights to fish them, called catch shares. If implemented worldwide, they say, this kind of market-based management could reverse a destructive global trend. Says David Festa of the Environmental Defense Fund in San Francisco, California, \"This gives definitive, concrete proof that this tool does end overfishing.\" \u2026Worm\u2019s team had analyzed all the large marine ecosystems in the world and found that those with declining biodiversity tended to have more collapsed fisheries, defined as yields less than 10% of historical maximums.  .. Each fisher was allocated a number of individual transferable quotas (ITQs), which they can use to catch fish or sell to others. The quotas are a percentage of the total allowable catch, which is set by regulators each year \u2026Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland, among others, claimed success with this approach, but no one had done a comprehensive analysis. Costello, Gaines, and Lynham examined more than 11,135 fisheries worldwide. Only 14% of the 121 fisheries using ITQs or similar methods had collapsed, compared with the 28% collapsed among fisheries without ITQs. Had all the world\u2019s fisheries implemented catch-share management in 1970, the researchers found, only 9% would have collapsed by 2003. The findings are conservative, Costello explains, because most ITQ systems have been put into place fairly recently; each year of rights-based management makes a collapse 0.5% less likely.Added 9\/26: Global carbon emissions increased 2.9% in \u201907!","130":" Can Kids Consent?  Back in 1983, at the young age of 18, my old friend Max More published an article saying he didn\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with adults propositioning kids for sex.It is difficult to comprehend how merely becoming friendly with a child, and then encouraging him or her to indulge in sexual activities, can be a violation of rights. \u2026 Many people will object that \u2026 individuals below the age of consent, do not know what they are doing, and therefore the compliance is not voluntary at all. I believe this argument is fallacious, and that it is invariably presented by a kind of mental reflex action, and not as a result of conscious deliberation. \u2026 Does it really matter whether a young child has experienced any form of sexual arousal before? Does it really matter whether the child has any understanding of sex? Sex is just another source of pleasure, a potentially potent source perhaps, but basically little different to any other. If there is nothing objectionable about an adult giving a child sweets or toys, why is giving sexual pleasure wrong? \u2026 If a child does not want to go to court, has not told the parents about his or her sexual activities, and has shown no signs of upset or fear, then there is no justification for assuming the use of coercion. (more)Today, Max backpedals:In my foolish arrogance, I wrote about a topic that I was then too na\u00efve to properly understand. \u2026 I was right to defend the free speech rights of a highly unpopular group. I was right to question the validity of a universal law of consent that ignores the maturity or lack of maturity of each individual. \u2026 Where I was wrong is in basing a view of maximal freedom on an inadequate conception of consent. Defining fully the conditions for real consent is difficult, but clearly lack of resistance is insufficient to indicate consent. If someone lacks understanding of what they are getting into, they may have agreed but have not consented. Consent requires agreement after thoughtful consideration. (more)But we almost never understand the full implications of our actions. Who really understands the implications of getting married, having kids, choosing a career, or choosing a national citizenship?  But we usually say adults consent to such things.  So what does it take to enable consent?When someone makes you an offer, it is reasonable to expect them to reveal possible downsides, and even to help you to hear from folks who recommend against accepting their offer. If your choice has a big effect on a third party (i.e., parents who\u2019d fund a pregnancy), it can be reasonable to seek their approval. And if your choice isn\u2019t very time critical, it is also reasonable to have some time to think it over. \u201cMany people have come to regret this; George knows more. Tell me your choice tomorrow.\u201dYes kids can make mistakes and we might want to limit their ability to make mistakes.  But adults can make lots of mistakes too; why treat kids so differently? Yes people change over time, and so we may want to limit how much young folks can commit their older selves. And yes teen brains change more rapidly than adult brains. But if we let 20 year olds make huge commitments, like marriage or citizenship, that limit their quite different 60 year old selves, why shouldn\u2019t we let 15 year olds make choices limiting their 25 year old selves. Do teen sex choices limit distant future choices anywhere near as much as do marriage, kids, careers, etc.?Aside from the issues I\u2019ve mentioned, my training in the social and human sciences doesn\u2019t offer me any more analytical tools to distinguish thirteen year olds from adults regarding sexual consent. I\u2019m not saying kids can resaonably consent; I\u2019m just suggesting that standard theories offer little support for saying they can\u2019t.So why are we so reluctant to let kids make their own choices, and yet so adamant that similar adults choices should be free? One obvious explanation is status; we affirm our higher status as adults by limiting what kids can do. But I suspect there is more:If culture is far, then in near mode we become more like a common universal human, and in far mode we diverge to become the different \u201csubspecies\u201d according to our different cultures. Culture being mainly far might help explain why \u2026 we are far more paternalistic toward kids than adults; perhaps we distrust kids as folks from other cultures, since kids have not yet fully diverged to join our subspecies.","131":" Think of the (Alien) Children!

He also suggests we share his anger that others do not financially subsidize his favored arts, and that other kinds of musicians get more attention.Me, I can admire his dedication, but I can\u2019t see much net social value from subsidizing his favored art over others, via money or status, or even from so subsidizing art in general. I can see the point of subsidizing innovation, at least innovation that can accumulate to benefit many future generations. But by great practice getting nearly as good as the best at intuitively understanding a 300 year old composer? How can that accumulate? Pop music at least somewhat more clearly accumulates over generations, though it isn\u2019t clear that\u2019s a net gain over the losses from fighting for top pop status.Just because something is impressive, even at a very deep visceral level, doesn\u2019t make it worth subsidizing.","134":" Forget 9\/11  Opening my Sunday comics this morning I see half are not-funny 9\/11 memorials.

(more)New studies lay out this process in more detail:In the domain of energy, \u2026 when individuals [were made to] feel unknowledgeable about an issue, participants increasingly trusted in the government to manage various environmental technologies, and increasingly supported the status quo in how the government makes decisions regarding the application of those technologies. \u2026 When people felt unknowledgeable with social issues, they felt more dependent on the government, which lead to increased trust.When they feel unknowledgeable about a threatening social issue, \u2026 [people] also appear motivated to avoid learning new information about it. \u2026 In the context of an imminent oil shortage\u2014as opposed to a distant one\u2014participants who felt that the issue was \u201cabove their heads\u201d reported an increased desire to adopt an \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d mentality toward that issue, relative to those who saw oil management as a relatively simple issue.This effect \u2026 is at least partly due to participants\u2019 desire to protect their faith in the capable hands of the government. Among those who felt more affected by the recession, experimentally increasing domain complexity eliminated the tendency to seek out information. These individuals avoided not only negative information but also vague information, that is, the types of information that held the potential (according to pretesting) to challenge the idea that the government can manage the economy. Positive information was not avoided in the same way. (more)I (again) suspect we act similarly toward medicine, law, and other authorities: we trust them more when we feel vulnerable to them, and we then avoid info that might undermine such trust. It is extremely important that we understand how this works, so that we can find ways around it. This is my guess for humanity\u2019s biggest failing.","136":" In Obscurity Errors Remain  The May 17 Nature suggests that papers in less prestigious journals are less likely to be checked by readers for errors:Murat Cokol and his colleagues at \u2026 Columbia ..identified 596 retracted articles \u2013 flaggged as such by PubMed \u2013 and found \u2026 Journals with high impact factors retract more papers, and low-impact journals are more likely not to retract the, the study finds.  It also suggests that high and low-impact journals differ little in detecting flawed articles before they are published.  \u2026 Cokol argues that the larger number of retractions in high impact journals reflects the fact that they receive more scrutiny. Not surprising, but pregnant with implications.","137":" Why Did Religion Change?  In his new book How Religion Evolved: And Why It Endures, Robin Dunbar reviews many details of the history and correlates of religion. He says that religion\u2019s main function is to aid group cohesion, and that religion has been key to allowing humans to sustain larger groups. While I have doubts about how well he explains these details, his book gives me an excuse to return to this important topic.To review his review, many animals travel in groups to protect against outside threats, via treating other group members either generically or via simple status ladders. But primates formed large groups via treating every other member differently, especially via hugs and grooming. Primates thus needed big brains to manage the politics of such groups.Our especially big brains have allowed human groups to get even larger before fragmenting due to internal conflicts. To further support the social cohesion that can sustain larger groups, we evolved smiles, laughter, singing, dancing, communal eating, drugs, sacrifices, humor, emotional story telling, more rituals, and moralizing gods. And we felt closer to associates with whom we shared language, place of origin, child to adult path, hobbies, worldview, musical taste, and sense of humor.We also evolved trance\/mystic experiences, often with romance-like feelings, and often enhanced by drugs. And we evolved supernatural beliefs, with which we made sense of the world, felt power over it, and could accuse associates of witchcraft. Religion is built especially on these two foundations.All of this makes sense to me. The puzzle I see is that we\u2019ve seen big changes over time, in which the relative importance of these factors has changed. How can we explain such changes?Language seems to have arisen about 500Kya. Our earliest spirituality apparently included altered mental states such as trances, and animism, wherein most everything around us had a spirit. Roughly 100Kya our ancestors started to put valuable goods into their graves, suggesting beliefs in an afterlife. Such beliefs seem to go together with ancestor worship, and with shamans who specialize in religion.Starting roughly 10Kya, with the farming revolution, humans started to live more densely, and built special religious spaces. They also found more potent drugs, such as poppy seeds and beer. We then turned to ritual (often human) sacrifice to capricious gods. In larger communities, we soon after saw social stratification, including a separate classes of priests, especially when food storage was possible. In this kind of religion, rituals were a communal duty, to placate the gods, and individual beliefs were unimportant.Then starting roughly 4Kya, near the \u201cAxial Age\u201d, we saw the rise of a new kind of religion associated with farming and herding in even larger communities, at the latitudes where such larger communities were possible. Most \u201ctraditional\u201d religions of today arose during this ancient era. This type of religion was centered on individual beliefs in moralizing gods described in writings that told of stories and doctrines. Religion became a personal duty, often resulting from a personal choice, and love and forgiveness came to matter more, relative to the sheer power of gods.Finally, we have recently seen a great and somewhat puzzling decline in religion, apparently in association with rising wealth, even though we still have great needs for group cohesion.To explain these changes, it helps little to point to the timeless advantages of these many strategies. For example, both gods who punish moral violations and also capricious gods who demand ritual sacrifices seem useful for promoting social cohesion. So why did they arise at the particular times they did? Dunbar doesn\u2019t say much on this.It seems to me that we must focus on using changes to explain changes. For example, perhaps communal responsibility for ritual sacrifice became much more socially potent when aided by drugs in the new religious spaces built for new larger denser communities. And perhaps personal responsibility and beliefs toward moralizing loving gods became much more socially potent when aided by priests who consulted written stories and doctrines.If \u201cwoke\u201d is a new \u201creligion,\u201d then it seems a complement to drugs, it lacks sacred texts, and it often sacrifices humans to pay for a collective guilt, in front of big crowds in the special big public spaces of social media. And it seems to create a new class of priests, and perhaps also a new stratification of the population. That sure sounds a lot like the religious style of the first half of the farming era; is that style returning now?","138":" Blocked State Innovation  I\u2019ve complained that regulation usually slows innovation. For example, huge driverless cars gains seem needlessly delayed by excess regulation (Tyler agrees). The problem, however, is not government per se, but the citizens to whom government defers. Politics is not about policy; voters are far more interested in showing off symbolic stances than in giving citizens more of what they want.But to be fair, citizens hinder not only private innovation, but also government innovation. Long ago when people were imagining a future of cheap computing and communication, they imagined dramatic gains from government databases and citizen monitoring. But then some warned of how such data and monitoring could support tyranny, and ever since most voters have been so eager to signal their disapproval of such Big Brother domination that they are unwilling to consider the most promising government innovations in data and monitoring.For example, me a year ago:Overall my students oppose change, moderately favoring whatever is the status quo. So I was quite surprised to see \u2026 85% of my students said yes to: Should all medical practice data be published, aside from data identifying patients?I assigned this paper topic again this year and, combining the two years, 76% of 76 students favored the change, which correlated 0.29 with student ability to identify relevant pro\/con arguments. Again, I don\u2019t grade students on their position, I don\u2019t say what I support, and students usually oppose change. (For example, they overwhelmingly opposed stricter public-place policies on hand washing after sneezing or using restrooms.)Last year, commenters\u2019 main complaint was that it is impossible guarantee privacy. And this is true. In principle, any piece of info you publish about someone could be the last little clue someone else needs to uncover a great secret about them. It all depends on what other info people reveal, and to whom. The only safe policy is to never publish anything about anyone. And since info supposedly only visible to government employees are often leaked via bribes, the only really safe policy is to never collect any info.But note that this same argument applies to every piece of info the government reveals about anyone, including date of birth, addresses, who\/when they marry or divorce, professional licenses, lawsuits, bankruptcies, tax liens, criminal records, etc. The reason few complain about privacy leaks due to such revelations is that most folks have adapted their other info behavior to expecting this info to be made public.Similarly, if we gave sufficient advanced warning on a new regime of revealing all med info (minus directly identifying info), most people could adapt their other info behavior to preserve the privacy they want. Don\u2019t let friends drive you to the doc if you don\u2019t want them to know who is your doc. Of course some would mistakenly reveal themselves, and illegal bribery would reveal more. But that can be a price worth paying if there is much to be gained.Alas, while even my undergrads can see that revealing all med info could easily meet a cost benefit test, voter distaste for anything smacking of Big Brother will probably long block this innovation. This even though recent legal changes go a long way to actually enabling future dictators:Our Presidents can now, on their own: order assassinations, including American citizens; operate secret military tribunals; engage in torture; enforce indefinite imprisonment without due process; order searches and seizures without proper warrants. (more)Citizens don\u2019t make a careful tradeoff between social value and preventing future dictators. Instead, thoughtless voters enable Big Brother while symbolically opposing him, and block useful government innovation in the process.","139":" Real Drama  I\u2019ve now seen all nine of the 2013 Best Picture Oscar nominees. Metacritic.com rates Zero Dark Thirty highest at 95, but gives second highest at 94 to my favorite, Amour. (Intrade gives Argo, rated 84, a 72% chance, and Lincoln, rated 86, a 23% chance, to win.)There\u2019s an apt old curse, \u201cMay you live in interesting times.\u201d Which highlights the fact that while we like stories with drama, we don\u2019t actually want drama in our lives. If you ignore the very end, and the fact that the characters are very high status artists, Amour is quite realistic and by far the drama most likely to actually be experienced by many of you. Which is why most folks don\u2019t like it, because they don\u2019t actually want to see realistic ordinary drama.Amour is about a women who gets sick and then dies. I was stuck by the fact that what most bothered her and her husband were the insults to her pride. They could mostly handle the pain, the drudgery, and the loss of opportunity. But the loss of status, oh that stung.I was struck by something similar lately while reading the classic Studs Terkel book Working, in which dozens of ordinary workers tell how they feel about their jobs. While they sometimes complain about being bored or tired, they seem mostly ok with this. What really bothers them is when other people don\u2019t give them as much respect or pay as they think they deserve. Again, it is status that seems to drive them most.I found this quote interesting:I would like to see a building, say, the Empire State, I would like to see on one side of it a foot-wide strip from top to bottom with the name of every bricklayer, the name of every electrician, with all the names. So when a guy walked by, he could take his son and say, \u201cSee, that\u2019s me over there on the forty-fifth floor. I put the steel beam in.\u201d Picasso can point to a painting. What can I point to? A writer can point to a book. Everybody should have something to point to. (Studs Terkel, Working)I\u2019d guess that if building makers could get this if they were willing to take a 5% pay cut to pay for it, and that it doesn\u2019t happen because such workers don\u2019t want it that much. Anyone know how much of a pay cut people take to get their name in the credits of a movie? How much of a pay cut to get your name shown as author of a novel? Do artists care more about getting visible public credit more than construction workers? If so, why?","140":" Noble Abstention  High voter turnout need not be good \u2013 not only is voting costly, but ignorant voters can make better candidates less likely to win.  Many have noted this last possibility, but I couldn\u2019t find any formal models (i.e., of abstention by varying-info-quality voters) \u2013 so I made my own.  My results depend on how unequally distributed is voter info; highly unequal info means only a handful should vote, while relatively equal info means most everyone should vote (ignoring voting costs).Let N voters simultaneously choose to abstain or vote for one of two apriori-equal candidates, based only on which action is more likely to elect the \u201cbest\u201d candidate.  Each voter gets an independent private binary signal with a chance (1+q)\/2 of accurately marking the best candidate.  Assume that if we rank voters by signal quality q (so the best voter has rank = 1, the next has rank = 2, etc.), we\u2019ll find quality and rank are related by a power law, q = q1*rank^-power.  (Voter signal qualities q>0 are common knowledge.)The following table shows how the number who do not abstain varies with info-quality power, for N = 10,000 voters, q1=0.1, and for two important cases.  In case 1, everyone uses the same q cutoff when deciding if to vote.  In case 2, each voter assumes (incorrectly) that no other voter abstains.The table shows that for powers above one less than 20% should vote, even if everyone else votes.  And if everyone does what they should, for powers above 1\/2, almost no one votes, while for powers below 1\/2 everyone votes.  (This last result holds for any N and q1.)Similar results probably hold for correlated and non-binary signals.  I\u2019m not sure how we could measure voter info inequality, but I\u2019d give at least two to one odds the effective power is above 1\/2, meaning few should vote.  Of course people vote not just to elect the best candidates overall, but to elect folks good for them personally, even when that hurts others.  But this isn\u2019t something we should celebrate or encourage, and most voters see themselves as instead voting to improve society overall.Large voter turnouts seem to me better understood as overconfidence leading to disagreement \u2013 we each think we just know better than others what is good for society.  But too few of us can be right on this for most of us to be (epistemically) rational here.  So I celebrate the noble abstainers, those willing to admit by staying home that their vote would probably just make things worse \u2013 we could use a lot more such folks.Added 16Sep: Any model with independent signals must either have large electorates get very certain to make the right choice, or must have voter signals get very weak with high rank.  A correlated signals model would be more realistic here.Added 02Nov20: Here\u2019s the actual spreadsheet I used for calculations.","141":" Only Do Math Homework  Following an identification strategy that allows us to largely eliminate unobserved student and teacher traits, we examine the effect of homework on math, science, English and history test scores for eighth grade students in the United States. Noting that failure to control for these effects yields selection biases on the estimated effect of homework, we find that math homework has a large and statistically meaningful effect on math test scores throughout our sample. However, additional homework in science, English and history are shown to have little to no impact on their respective test scores. (more)So does anyone think that once this result becomes better know, they\u2019ll stop assigning all but math homework? Me neither. Yes, maybe homework helps kids to learn things that their tests do not test. But more likely, homework functions to get kids used to doing a lot of work, in preparation for their future industry era jobs. Learning seems secondary.","142":" Work Signals  The average American worker gets 14 vacation days a year and only uses 12 of them. That adds up to 226 million unused vacation days, or approximately $34.3 billion dollars of work. That\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s not that surprising though as we are in one of the worst periods of unemployment in quite some time and many people are probably cutting back on vacation days in order to be more productive. It\u2019s not exactly fair but it\u2019s human nature, if I\u2019m concerned about getting fired then the last thing I\u2019m going to do is take a vacation day. (more)For workers ages 55 and older, the survey found that nearly 30 percent have between five and 10 vacation days left over at the end of each year. Further, it found that only a quarter of workers 55 and older had used up all of their allotted vacation time by year\u2019s end. (more)66% of employees failed to use up their vacation days last year. \u2026 \u201cTons of people feel they don\u2019t have the discretionary spending to take vacation, so they just stay at work.\u201d That\u2019s a very bad idea, experts say. \u201cThe research is clear that failing to take a vacation creates higher levels of stress and greater levels of disengagement at work,\u201d Matthews reports.\u201cIt\u2019s silly to think that giving up vacation is going to make your colleagues think how important you are,\u201d says \u2026 a career services expert. \u2026 \u201cTake your vacation and let them miss you.\u201d After all, you can never get back those days you didn\u2019t use\u2013or the once-in-a-lifetime memories they might have produced. \u201cVacations are underrated,\u201d agrees Joan Kane, a Manhattan psychologist who has worked as a therapist for 22 years. \u2026 They satisfy a deep need to feel that you\u2019re in control of your own time. \u201cOn vacation you have no boss to satisfy.\u201d (more)Oddly, most who comment on unused vacation time both note that there exist signaling incentives to work more than required, and tell people that taking vacation time would be good for them, as if they were ignorant of such advantages. This seems a common idealistic message \u2013 exhorting people to do what they would if there were no signaling incentives. If the point were to give people useful info this would be pointless, but if the point is to reaffirm shared sacred values, it works fine.While many commenters lament the presumed inefficiency of this signaling equilibrium, it is worth noting that employees often also inefficiently go out of their way to signal defiance of employers. Most employers are reluctant to cut wages in a downturn, to give employees frequent direct negative feedback, or to require them to wear uniforms, sing corporate songs, etc., all because employers know that employees would respond badly with signals of defiance. These signaling equilbria can be just as inefficient as taking too little vacation, but few commenters lament these distortions. Because the sacred shared values we want to affirm are more about defying firm authorities, rather than submitting to them.","143":" We Sweat Big Stuff Badly  Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff; and its all small stuff.Compared to unimportant decisions, for moderately important decisions we tend to do more thorough practical decision analyses. This is mainly because we try harder. Yet when we get to our most important decisions, our decision analyses tend to be less explicit, thorough, or practical. This is in part because we tend to see such issues as more symbolic, and more sacred.For example, we think more carefully about if and how to repair a car, compared to a broken pencil. Yet when it comes to thinking about repairing our bodies, our thinking tends to get less thorough and analytic. We would rather just trust our prestigious doctor, and those who conferred prestige on them, and not think about the subject. It seems that we mainly use medicine as a way to show that we care, instead of as a way to get well. And as a result, people who we randomly induce to get more medicine are not on average substantially healthier. That\u2019s a pretty big fail.We handle small conflicts all the time, and we put more effort into handling moderately important conflicts. Yet our biggest conflicts get handed over to a quite dysfunctional legal system. (A system few are willing to think of redesigning.) We each assume it works well until we personally have to deal with it. Then we try to just trust our prestigious lawyer. We show little interest in lawyer track records or incentive contracts; we just don\u2019t want to think about the topic.We are eager to connect with each other socially, and in a low key informal contexts where the same people regularly come into contact with each other, people will in fact chat, socialize, and get to know each other. In in those processes, they will successfully tend to get more contact with people they like better. But even the loneliest people are quite reluctant to directly approach strangers. We\u2019d rather stay lonely than to risk a clear public rejection.At home, we are generally capable of doing modest chores, and of learning the skills needed to do them. And we put more effort into learning the chores that matter more. But at school and on jobs, we often self-sabotage and put in low effort on the biggest choices, in order to make failure less of a signal of what we could accomplish if only we\u2019d try harder. I\u2019ve done this many times in my life. Often I was most productive when I\u2019d play hokey from one \u201cshould do\u201d project to work on another \u201cnot supposed to be doing\u201d project.Our disfunction re big work choices seems especially dramatic in the case of people who choose hobbies and video games with tasks, and related performance feedback, are quite similar to those on real jobs. They say they\u2019d rather not work for money because they hate the prospect of being criticized or looked down on for poor job performance.Yes many, perhaps even most, people slowly \u201cmature\u201d over time into becoming better able to \u201cown\u201d and practically consider big decisions. But even so, most of us still aren\u2019t very good at this. So as a lot rides on such big decisions, how can we get people to better sweat the big stuff?One approach is to pair people with incentivized expert advisors who can push particular decisions, more or less gently. These advisors can be more calculating and dispassionate, as such decisions don\u2019t loom as large for them personally. And less individual more communal societies often do pair people with associates who advise them, though it is often unclear how expert or well-incentivized is such advice. Fans of regulation also suggest that regulators would do well in this advisor role, though critics of regulation have doubts.This issue is one of the reasons I\u2019m so interested in designing and testing better personal agents. Like tax career agents, life maintenance organizations, or legal liability vouchers. Such agents can arguably be both expert and well-incentivized to advise well. Making us more comfortable with encouraging ordinary folks to rely more on their advice, instead of on their own broken decision-making.Added 18Dec: Thought some claim that standard decision theory is inadequate for big decisions, I\u2019m not at all persuaded of that.","144":" Conspiracy Capacities  Huge brains helped primates fight via coalition politics, and language let human foragers enforce egalitarian norms against such fights.  If neutrally applied, such norms should have cut the gains to huge brains, yet we had the biggest brains. This suggests hierarchy and coalition politics continued via covert rule bending.  Support for this hypothesis comes from our highly evolved capacities for covert coalitions:Body Language \u2013 Winks and nods and other body language are not just redundant or complementary to our words. \u201cA wink and a nod\u201d is a common expression for a communication intended to be less visible to third parties, in particular to enable corruption.  Since we are very good at seeing where other eyes look, we can often communicate via the direction of our gaze. Our unconscious status moves include the high status looking directly and the low status looking away; this grants more eye-talk conspiracy power to the high status.Indirect Language \u2013 When talking with words, we commonly veil our language, instead of speaking directly.  Indirection makes it harder for others to interpret what your mean. So those who are very socially distant, lacking local context, may just not understand, while those closer may understand but be unable to prove what was meant; you\u2019d have plausible deniability.  By varying the indirection of our language we can control how close a circle can understand or prove what we say. Extreme indirection can also signal; if we see that we understand each other, we confirm our intelligence and close connection.Rumors \u2013 Even when rumors are expressed in direct language, they are not intended for all ears. We explicitly say to not tell certain others, or implicitly understand to only tell a shared coalition. At a minimum, we understand not to tell the subject of the rumor.  Spreading a mild rumor about a person allows us to test how well connected is that person.  If they never complain, perhaps they never heard of the rumor, and so are poorly connected, and thus can be conspired against more easily, perhaps via further rumors.These skills seem to me too well developed in humans today to have only begun with farming ten thousand years ago.  Compare them to our clumsy farming, war, and writing skills that have to be explicitly taught.  Clearly, foragers had great conspiracy capacities, and so often conspired, bending their egalitarian rules.","145":" Objectification As Emotional Labor  \u201cEmotional labor \u2026 [is] activities that are concerned wit the enhancement of others\u2019 emotional well-0being and with the provision of emotional support. \u2026 captures people\u2019s attempts to effectively managed the emotional climate within a relationship. (more; see also)Some complain that women do much emotional labor, labor which is overlooked and undervalued. Others point to male emotional labors that also seems overlooked: suffering more explicit rejection, suggesting options for others to shoot down, suppressing their own fears and complaints while indulging partners\u2019, and flattering partners while doing without flattery themselves.In this post I want to point out another kind of especially male emotional labor, a kind I have not heard others speak of: men pretend they love women for who they are, but let women admit they love men for those mens\u2019 love. That is, men \u201cobjectify\u201d women.Let me explain. Usually the strongest things we all want from our mates is to be wanted and loved for our direct objective features, like our looks, personality, smarts, kindness, etc. Wanted at least by someone who is good enough in key ways. But two people who have this as their main mating motive are poorly matched. If the other person mainly loves you for the fact that you love them, then they aren\u2019t loving you so much for your direct features, which is what you wanted them to love you for. So you aren\u2019t getting what you wanted.This problem is cut if one of the parties will at least pretend to mainly want the other for their direct features. And this men (tend to) do. Leading to stereotypes that male desires are simple and low and deceptive, allowing men to be freely denigrated and suspected of foul play. In contrast, the female desire to be loved is framed as deep, giving, and spiritual. For example, male consumption of porn is denigrated much more than is female consumption of romance novels.Such pretense carries risks. Men who believe it too much can be surprised to find sex alone doesn\u2019t satisfy, while women who believe it too much may withhold sex, demand too much for access to it, and be surprised when their man gives up on the pretense.Added 7p: Maybe what all parties really want is to be matched with a high status partner, which would as a result raise their own status. So matches between similar status people do give people as much of what they want as they\u2019d think feasible to get. Under this hypothesis, all the stuff they say about wanting to be wanted for features is misleading.","146":" Why Have Opinions?  I just surprised some people here at a conference by saying that I don\u2019t have opinions on abortion or gun control. I have little use for such opinions, and so haven\u2019t bothered to form them. Since that attitude seems to be unusual among my intellectual peers, let me explain myself.I see four main kinds of reasons to have opinions on subjects:Decisions \u2013 Sometimes I need to make concrete decisions where the best choice depends on particular key facts or values. In such cases I am forced to have opinions on those subjects, in order to make good decisions. I may well just adopt, without much reflection, the opinions of some standard expert source. I have to make a lot of decisions and don\u2019t have much time to reflect. But even so, I must have an opinion. And my incentives here tend to be toward having true opinions.Socializing \u2013 A wide range of topics come up when talking informally with others, and people tend to like you to express opinions on at least some substantial subset of those topics. They typically aren\u2019t very happy if you explain that you just adopted the opinion of some standard expert source without reflection, and so we are encouraged to \u201cthink for ourselves\u201d to generate such opinions. Here my incentives are to have opinions that others find interesting or loyal, which is less strongly (but not zero) correlated with truth.Research \u2013 As a professional intellectual, I specialize in particular topics. On those topics I generate opinions together with detailed supporting justifications for those opinions. I am evaluated on the originality, persuasiveness, and impressiveness of these opinions and justifications. These incentives are somewhat more strongly, but still only somewhat, correlated with truth.Exploration \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what future topics to research, and so continually explore a space of related topics which seem like they might have the potential to become promising research areas for me. Part of that process of exploration involves generating tentative opinions and justifications. Here it is even less important that these opinions be true than they help reveal interesting, neglected, areas especially well-suited to my particular skills and styles.Most topics that are appropriate for research have little in the way of personal decision impact. So intellectuals focus more on research reasons for such topics. Most intellectuals also socialize a lot, so they also generate opinions for social reasons. Alas most intellectuals generate these different types of opinions in very different ways. You can almost hear their mind gears shift when they switch from being careful on research topics to being sloppy on social topics. Most academics have a pretty narrow speciality area, which they know isn\u2019t going to change much, so they do relatively little exploration that isn\u2019t close to their specialty area.Research opinions are my best contribution to the world, and so are where I should focus my altruistic efforts. (They also give my best chance for fame and glory.) So I try to put less weight on socializing reasons for my opinions, and more weight on the exploration reasons. As long as I see little prospect of my research going anywhere near the abortion or gun control topics, I won\u2019t explore there much. Topics diagnostic of left vs. right ideological positions seem especially unlikely to be places where I could add something useful to what everyone else is saying. But I do explore a wide range of topics that seem plausibly related to areas in which I have specialized, or might specialize. I have specialized in far more different areas than have most academics. And I try to keep myself honest by looking for plausible decisions I might make related to all these topics, though that tends to be hard. If we had more prediction markets this could get much easier, but alas we do not.Of course if you care less about research, and more about socializing, your priorities could easily differ from mine.","147":" Response To Hossenfelder  In my last post I said:In her new book Lost in Math, theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder describes just how bad things have become. \u2026 To fix these problems, Hossenfelder proposes that theoretical physicists learn about and prevent biases, promote criticism, have clearer rules, prefer longer job tenures, allow more specialization and changes of fields, and pay peer reviewers. Alas, as noted in a Science review, Hossenfelder\u2019s proposed solutions, even if good ideas, don\u2019t seem remotely up to the task of fixing the problems she identifies.In the comments she took issue:I am quite disappointed that you, too, repeat the clearly false assertion that I don\u2019t have solutions to offer. \u2026 I originally meant to write a book about what\u2019s going wrong with academia in general, but both my agent and my editor strongly advised me to stick with physics and avoid the sociology. That\u2019s why I kept my elaborations about academia to an absolute minimum. You are right in complaining that it\u2019s sketchy, but that was as much as I could reasonably fit in.But I have on my blog discussed what I think should be done, eg here. Which is a project I have partly realized, see here. And in case that isn\u2019t enough, I have a 15 page proposal here. On the proposal I should add that, due to space limitations, it does not contain an explanation for why I think that\u2019s the right thing to do. But I guess you\u2019ll figure it out yourself, as we spoke about the \u201cprestige optimization\u201d last week.I admitted my error:I hadn\u2019t seen any of those 3 links, and your book did list some concrete proposals, so I incorrectly assumed that if you had more proposals then you\u2019d mention them in your book. I\u2019m happy to support your proposed research project. \u2026 I don\u2019t see our two proposals as competing, since both could be adopted.She agreed:I don\u2019t see them as competing either. Indeed, I think they fit well .Then she wrote a whole blog post elaborating!:And then there are those who, at some time in my life, handed me a piece of the puzzle I\u2019ve since tried to assemble; people I am sorry I forgot about. \u2026 For example \u2026 Robin Hanson, with whom I had a run-in 10 years ago and later met at SciFoo. I spoke with Robin the other day. \u2026 The reason I had an argument with him is that Robin proposed \u2013 all the way back in 1990 \u2013 that \u201cgambling\u201d would save science. He wanted scientists to bet on the outcomes of their colleagues\u2019 predictions and claimed this would fix the broken incentive structure of academia. I wasn\u2019t fond of Robin\u2019s idea back then. The major reason was that I couldn\u2019t see scientists spend much time on a betting market. \u2026But what if scientists could make larger gains by betting smartly than they could make by promoting their own research? \u201cWho would bet against their career?\u201d I asked Robin when we spoke last week. \u201cYou did,\u201d he pointed out. He got me there. \u2026 So, Robin is right. It\u2019s not how I thought about it, but I made a bet. \u2026 In other words, yeah, maybe a betting market would be a good idea. Snort.My thoughts have moved on since 2007, so have Robin\u2019s. During our conversation, it became clear our views about what\u2019s wrong with academia and what to do about it have converged over the years. To begin with, Robin seems to have recognized that scientists themselves are indeed unlikely candidates to do the betting. Instead, he now envisions that higher education institutions and funding agencies employ dedicated personnel to gather information and place bets. \u2026This arrangement makes a lot of sense to me. First and foremost, it\u2019s structurally consistent. \u2026 Second, it makes financial sense. \u2026 Third, it is minimally intrusive yet maximally effective.  \u2026 So, I quite like Robin\u2019s proposal. Though, I wish to complain, it\u2019s too vague to be practical and needs more work. It\u2019s very, erm, academic. \u2026That\u2019s also why Robin\u2019s proposal looks good to me. It looks better the more I think about it. Three days have passed, and now I think it\u2019s brilliant. Funding agencies would make much better financial investments if they\u2019d draw on information from such a prediction market. Unfortunately, without startup support it\u2019s not going to happen. And who will pay for it?This brings me back to my book. Seeing the utter lack of self-reflection in my community, I concluded scientists cannot solve the problem themselves. The only way to solve it is massive public pressure. The only way to solve the problem is that you speak up. Say it often and say it loudly, that you\u2019re fed up watching research funds go to waste on citation games. Ask for proposals like Robin\u2019s to be implemented.As Hossenfelder has been kind enough to consider my proposal in some detail, let me dig a bit into her proposal:We really need is a practical solution. And of course I have one on offer: An open-source software that allows every researcher to customize their own measure for what they think is \u201cgood science\u201d based on the available data. That would include the number of publications and their citations. But there is much more information in the data which currently isn\u2019t used. \u2026 individualized measures wouldn\u2019t only automatically update as people revise criteria, but they would also counteract the streamlining of global research and encourage local variety. (more)We created this website so you can generate a keyword cloud from your publications. You can then download the image and add it to your website or your CV. You can also generate a keyword cloud for your institution so that, rather than listing the always-same five research groups, you can visually display your faculty\u2019s activity. In addition, you can use our website to search for authors with interests close to a list of input keywords or author names. This, so we hope, will aid you in finding speakers for conferences or colloquia while avoiding the biases that creep in when we rely on memory or personal connections. (more)The basic idea here seems to be that what scientists read today is distorted somehow by their reading systems. For example, instead of just reading the good stuff, current reading systems might induce scientists to read prestigious and popular stuff. If so, then by giving scientists better tools for finding good things to read, distortions would be fewer, good science would be read more, and thereby gain more prestige and popularity, relative to the current situation.Okay, current systems for finding things to read do probably introduce some distortions. But today there are so many ways to find things to read, and so many ways to make new reading systems, that I really find it hard to see this as the limiting factor. Instead, I expect that incentives are mainly to blame, such as for example biasing readers toward prestigious and popular stuff. You and your papers are looked on more favorably when they are seen as building on other prestigious and popular papers.Consider an analogy with citations. Someone who is honestly just trying to do good science will sometimes need to read other papers, and when they write papers they will sometimes make enough use of another paper that they should mention that fact as a citation. If we had a big population of people who read and cited papers solely for the purpose of doing science, and whose priorities were representative of science, then we could use stats on who this group read or cited as an indicator of scientific quality. You are higher quality if you write more things that are read or cited. And this quality metric could even be used to hand out publications, jobs, funding, etc.However, as we all know, simple citation counts have problems when these assumptions don\u2019t hold. When we count papers equally ignoring that some mattered more. Or when we count boring but prestigious and popular papers more. Or when referees lobby to get their works cited. Or when authors trade favors to cite allies. The same sort of incentives the distort who scientists cite can also distort who they read, especially when reading stats are made visible. Like when people today make bots to download their papers from servers to produce big download counts.I say the main problem is bad incentives, not bad what-to-read tools. So better tools to pursue existing incentives will make only limited gains.Added 20Dec: Okay, I just talked to Hossenfelder again, and she explained that the intended purpose of her metrics was to rate people when deciding whom to hire. But the problems are similar for metrics to decide who to read: once others can see your metric choice, you have incentives to push metrics that favor you personally,  and that make people see you as a wise not-too-nonconformist. It isn\u2019t bad to expand the space of easily used metrics, but I\u2019d mainly want to push for visible evaluations of metrics on grounds of how useful they are when we all use them.  For example, given a matrix of how well each metric predicts future values of other metrics, which metrics seem the most predictive overall?","148":" Wishful Dreaming  The NYT just reported on the JPSP article on dreams I reported on in January.  I wrote:I'll bet we process dream experiences much like we process fictional experiences.  Our tendency to treat fictional and dream experience as real evidence helps us to credibly believe things that it is in our interest for others to think we believe.  The NYT notes dreams interpretation is self-serving:Even the nonbelievers showed a weakness for certain heavenly dreams, like one in which God commanded them to take a year off to travel the world. Agnostics rated that dream as significantly more meaningful than the dream of God commanding them to spend a year working in a leper colony. \u2026Dreamers\u2019 self-serving bias \u2026 Once you see how flexible dream interpretation can be, you can appreciate why it has always been such a popular tool for decision-making. Relying on your dreams for guidance is like the political ritual of appointing an \u201cindependent blue-ribbon panel\u201d to resolve an issue. You can duck any personal responsibility for action while pretending to rely on an impartial process, even though you\u2019ve stacked the panel with your own friends and will ignore any advice that conflicts with your desires. Charity work, no; margaritas, s\u00ed. \u2026And dreams serve many social functions:\"It may also be a good idea not to tell people about their undesirable behavior in your dreams, as they may infer that your dreams reveal your true feelings about them.\u201d  \u2026 You should still probably pay attention when, say, your romantic partner tells you about a dream in which you were caught in bed with your partner\u2019s friend.","149":" Religion As Standard  Systems often get locked into standards. For example, computer systems get locked into programming language and operating system standards. When people notice that existing standards have unsatisfactory features, they often try to create and promote alternate standards. Such attempts usually fail, however, due to the large costs of coordinating to switch to new standards, including the loss of complementary investments into old standards. In order to induce a switch, expected gains from a new better standard have be large enough to compensate for switching costs, and users need to coordinate their actions in order to switch.Hopes for a libertarian revolution seem similar. Yes, there may be gains from transferring traditional government services (like schools, roads, fire protection) to private substitutes. But we have many complementary investments in an existing government-provision system that has many self-reinforcing elements. If most people see the potential gains from switching to be few and weak compared to the substantial cost of switching, it just won\u2019t happen. So big change probably won\u2019t happen until some new context where many folks expect private substitutes to work much better.Strong atheist critiques of religion also seem similar. Religious people often say things that sound crazy, at least when interpreted as claims intended to say things similar to, and evaluated by the usual critical standards of, most other intellectual realms. Atheists want to apply relatively uniform standards of interpretation and evaluation across wide ranges of intellectual claims. Such uniform standards should allow intellectuals to draw more reliable inferences combining insights from many diverse topic areas.Religion, however, is a complex system integrating emotions, behaviors, relationships, and things that sound and are treated somewhat like intellectual claims. We have made many expensive complementary investments into this religious system, investments that would be expensive to translate to a substitute system. Religious folks understand that treating their religious claims as crazy would detract from the many complex functions that these claims serve within the complex religious experience. So they would rather apply different intellectual standards to these claims. They\u2019d rather say \u201cDon\u2019t take this so literally, don\u2019t be so reductionist; this kind of talk is just different.\u201dOf course defenders of religion also don\u2019t want to say that they are just making comforting noises that have no intellectual meaning; a sense that their words are somewhat like intellectual claims is part of what lets those noises be comforting. And they don\u2019t want to clarify in much detail just what exactly they are saying, in the usual intellectual terms. They\u2019d rather say \u201cHaven\u2019t you got other topics to go investigate? Why come to our area and mess with things you don\u2019t understand? How can you be so sure of your intellectual standards and your preferred interpretations of our words, so as to put at risk all this useful religious practice?\u201dIt seems to me that religion will handily win this contest for a long time to come. The social support that can be mustered by a few intellectuals hoping for more uniform standards of interpretation and evaluation across diverse topics seems quite weak compared to strong interests others have in the usual complex religious processes. Even if many broad-thinking intellectuals decide to pick a noisy fight over this, most of society will just shrug their shoulders and ignore it. Surely this fact is known to most atheists, so this can\u2019t really be about inducing a social change to a new less objectionable religion substitute. So it is probably mostly about other things, such as status contests within the smaller world of intellectuals.FYI, some relevant quotes from the atheism critic James Wood:I can\u2019t be the only reader who finds himself in broad agreement with the conclusions of the New Atheists, while disliking some of the ways they reach them. \u2026 [They have] a simplistic reading of how people actually hold those beliefs. \u2026 For millions of people, religious \u201cbelief\u201d is not a matter of just totting up stable, creedal propositions (\u201cI believe that Jesus is the son of God\u201d, \u201cI believe that I will go to heaven when I die\u201d, and so on), but a matter of more unconscious, daily practice (\u201cNow it is time to kneel down, face Mecca and pray\u201d). This kind of defence of the deep embeddedness of religious practice has been influenced by Wittgenstein \u2013 for whom, say, kissing an icon was a bit like loving one\u2019s mother; something that cannot be subjected to an outsider\u2019s rational critique. \u2026 We know that plenty of people hold religious beliefs that are also propositions \u2026 Rather than simply declaring all religious belief to be non-propositional, which is manifestly untrue, it would be more interesting to examine what might be called the practice of propositional beliefs. We know that people believe all kinds of things, as propositions. But how do they believe them? In this area, the New Atheism has nothing very interesting to say, except to wish away all such beliefs. (more)Modern Godless man, deprived of the old spirits and demons, and thrown into a world in which there is no one to appeal to outside his own mind, finds it hard to experience the spiritual \u201cfullness\u201d that his ancestors experienced. \u2026 Where are we left when evolutionary biology tries to reduce the strong evaluation we make about altruism by claiming that, like all animal behavior, it is just a contrivance that benefits our selfish genes? In Taylor\u2019s terms, the question is whether an \u201cupper language,\u201d in which we describe altruism as noble and admirable, can be fully captured by a \u201clower language,\u201d of instrumental and biological explanation, a language that scrupulously avoids the vocabulary of purpose, intentionality, design, teleology.Taylor is skeptical that it can; he worries about the undermining allure of such reduction, and not without cause. These days, one is continually running up against a crass evolutionary neuroscientific pragmatism that is loved by popular evolutionary psychologists and newspaper columnists (of the kind who argue that we are happiest living in suburbs and voting Republican because neuroscience has \u201cproved\u201d that a certain bit of our brain lights up upon seeing Chevy Chase or Greenwich; or that we all like novels because stories must have taught us, millennia ago, how to negotiate our confusing hunter-gatherer society\u2014I exaggerate only a little). Taylor is right to claim that the popularity of this type of reduction is \u201cone of the most burning intellectual issues in modern life.\u201d (more)","150":" Legalize Dud Drugs  According to Engber[\u2018s article], Human Growth Hormone (HGH or GH) has little to no performance enhancing-benefits. \u2026 I have the benefit of working down the hall from several exercise physiologists.  I forwarded [his] article to my colleague, John McLester. \u2026 \u201cOh yeah, I agree with [Engber]. This isn\u2019t even controversial in exercise physiology. \u2026 There is no evidence of [benefit from bigger muscles]. It seems that the muscle that is developed is abnormal and not mature. I\u2019ll point you to some studies (see below). \u2026With [Major League Baseball]\u2019s adoption of mandatory testing for steroids, many thought that home run rates would drop dramatically. They didn\u2019t, and many felt that the lack of a test for HGH could be part of the explanation. Well, it\u2019s time for the scientists working on such a test to start something else more important.That is John Bradbury.  He interprets:The illegality of growth hormone actually promotes its use in sports. \u2026 The banning of a drug by anti-doping authorities sends a loud and incorrect signal that it works. \u2026 Therefore, I believe that legalizing growth hormone is needed to send the signal that it doesn\u2019t work, largely to undo the widespread common belief that growth hormone does improve performance. \u2026 Think of the powerful effect it would have if MLB pulled growth hormone off its banned list. I can\u2019t imagine a more powerful signal of a drug\u2019s lack of potency as a performance enhancer.

You better live your own life and wake up to the facts!\u201d another snapped back. \u201cNo two men are Jesus Christs. \u2026 I am the Good Lord!\u201d the third interjected, barely concealing his anger. \u2026Very little seems to shift the identities of the self-appointed Messiahs. They debate, argue, at one point come to blows, but show few signs that their beliefs have become any less intense. Only Leon seems to waver, eventually asking to be addressed as \u201cDr Righteous Idealed Dung\u201d instead of his previous moniker of \u201cDr Domino dominorum et Rex rexarum, Simplis Christianus Puer Mentalis Doctor, reincarnation of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.\u201d Rokeach interprets this more as an attempt to avoid conflict than a reflection of any genuine identity change. The Christs explain one another\u2019s claims to divinity in predictably idiosyncratic ways: Clyde, an elderly gentleman, declares that his companions are, in fact, dead, and that it is the \u201cmachines\u201d inside them that produce their false claims, while the other two explain the contradiction by noting that their companions are \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cduped\u201d or that they don\u2019t really mean what they say. \u2026Whether scientist or psychiatric patient, we assume others are more likely to be biased or misled than we are, and we take for granted that our own beliefs are based on sound reasoning and observation. This may be the nearest we can get to revelation\u2014the understanding that our most cherished beliefs could be wrong. (more)Political and religious groups often save their strongest antagonism for groups with similar but a bit different positions. (Think \u201cJudea People\u2019s Front\u201d vs. \u201cPeople\u2019s Front of Judea.\u201d)  Similarly, contrarian groups tend to be made most uncomfortable not by exposure to mainstream authorities that disagree, but by exposure to other contrarian groups that look similar from a distance, but who have unpalatable beliefs.For example, contrarians with academic support are happy to discount the non-academic majority, while contrarians opposed by academics are happy to say academics are clueless.  But contrarians with academic support are made uncomfortable by other unpalatable contrarians who also have academic support.So to help you question your contrarian beliefs, look for other contrarian groups that look similar from a distance, with beliefs you are reluctant to endorse.  Look for groups with similar members or leaders, i.e., similar age, gender, income, academic credentials, tech-orientation, political leaning, years devoted to topic, etc.  If you can\u2019t swallow their beliefs, you\u2019ll have to admit you can\u2019t attribute their mistake to such features.","152":" Fem Hiring Jealousy  I\u2019d always wondered why men get a higher wage premium than women for good looks.  Now we learn jealousy by women in charge of hiring seems a likely explanation:Job applicants in Europe and in Israel increasingly imbed a headshot of them- selves in the top corner of their CVs. We sent 5312 CVs in pairs to 2656 advertised job open- ings. In each pair, one CV was without a picture while the second, otherwise almost identical CV contained a picture of either an attractive male\/female or a plain-looking male\/female. Employer callbacks to attractive men are significantly higher than to men with no picture and to plain-looking men, nearly doubling the latter group. Strikingly, attractive women do not enjoy the same beauty premium. In fact, women with no picture have a significantly higher rate of callbacks than attractive or plain-looking women. We explore a number of explanations and provide evidence that female jealousy of attractive women in the workplace is a primary reason for the punishment of attractive women.For every additional point a judge assigns to a photographed person\u2019s beauty, the judge rates the same person\u2019s intelligence .29 points higher on average. This result is highly signi\ufb01cant and contradicts the dumb-blonde hypothesis. \u2026 A female subject who is rated one point higher for her beauty is also perceived to be an extra .26 points more intelligent on average.We asked each company surveyed to indicate what message is conveyed by a \u2026 candidate who includes a picture. \u2026 Thirty-six percent of the respondents reacted positively to males\u2019 inclusion of a picture, invoking terms such \u201cpresentable\u201d and \u201ccon\ufb01dent\u201d. Only 28% of the respondents expressed negative associations for male photographs. By contrast, negative sentiments were the predominant response (56%) to females CVs with pictures. \u201cNot serious\u201d and \u201can attempt to market herself via her appearance\u201d were among the reactions. A mere 12% of respondents expressed a positive association. These \ufb01ndings suggest that we cannot rule out the negative signaling story. \u2026 93% of the [hiring] respondents in our sample were female \u2026We have presented a range of evidence that suggests that female jealousy is part of the observed and unexpected discrimination against attractive females. To begin, women mostly do the initial screening of CVs. When the hiring is done by the company in which the hired job candidate will work, these women discriminate strongly against attractive women and only attractive women, treating all other picture CVs similarly to the paired no-picture CV. Outside employment agencies in charge of hiring provide a control group. They differentiate signi\ufb01cantly between the picture and paired no-picture CVs in all cases, with the attractive females being the only exception: employment agencies discrimination against attractive women is only weakly signi\ufb01cant. (more; HT Dan Houser.)So now that firms know this, will they still let female hiring folks discriminate against pretty female applicants?  Will the law and politicians allow such blatant unfairness to continue? Of course they will. But it is interesting to consider why exactly this will happen.","153":" Catheter Infection Law  Consider the vast legal apparatus we maintain to reduce the US\u2019s ~30,000 annual car crash deaths. This includes a vast complex of traffic laws, such as re speeding and stop signs, auto safety rules and tests, and huge police forces and courts devoted to enforcing all this.Now consider that catheter-related infections at hospitals killl a similar number of folks, and can be almost completely stopped via a simple five step procedure, and yet we have almost no related legal apparatus. No laws require hospitals to follow these procedures, or to pass tests showing they can reliably do so, no police checks to see that they actually do so, nor do courts adjudicate many disputes here. Instead we mainly hope for results from \u201cfederally funded programs\u201d that pay hospitals who start programs where they say they will look into the problem. Todays\u2019 Post:An estimated 80,000 patients per year develop catheter-related bloodstream infections, or CRBSIs \u2014 which can occur when tubes that are inserted into a vein to monitor blood flow or deliver medication and nutrients are improperly prepared or left in longer than necessary. About 30,000 patients die as a result, according to the [CDC]. \u2026 Yet evidence suggests hospital workers could all but eliminate CRBSIs by following a five-step checklist that is stunningly basic: (1) Wash hands with soap; (2) clean patient\u2019s skin with an effective antiseptic; (3) put sterile drapes over the entire patient; (4) wear a sterile mask, hat, gown and gloves; (5) put a sterile dressing over the catheter site. \u2026A federally funded program implementing these measures in intensive-care units in Michigan hospitals reduced the incidence of CRBSIs by two-thirds, saving more than 1,500 lives and $200 million in the first 18 months. \u2026 \u201cThe cost of implementing [such programs] is about $3,000 per infection, while an infection costs between $30,000 to $36,000.\u201dFrom the numbers above, the cost to society of each infection is ~3\/8 of a life, which is at least a million dollars. So hosptials internalize ~3% of the social cost of such infections. In contrast, car drivers typically internalize at least 30% of the social cost of car accidents they influence.   By this measure, it would make more sense to completely eliminate all traffic laws and trust personal incentives to moderate car accidents than it does to trust hospital financial incentives to cut catheter-related infections. So why do we trust hospitals so much more than car drivers?Added: Apparently attempts to try these checklists were banned for a while as unethical medical experiments, because careful records were being kept.","154":" Jiro Lives Worth Living  Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a well-reviewed documentary mostly celebrating the world\u2019s best sushi chef. Which is worth pondering, because Jiro is an extreme workaholic. Roger Ebert:Jiro Ono is 85 years old. As a young boy, he ran away from home to become an apprentice in a restaurant and has been making sushi for more than 70 years. He is apparently not happy doing anything else and prefers to work all day, seven days a week, every day in the year. \u2026 You realize he must be a rich man. But to what end? \u2026 While watching it, I found myself drawn into the mystery of this man. Are there any unrealized wishes in his life? Secret diversions? Regrets? If you find an occupation you love and spend your entire life working at it, is that enough? (more)Jiro\u2019s life is also quite routine \u2013 he repeats the same actions over and over and over, always seeking slight adjustments to improve quality.I haven\u2019t seen anyone says this movie describes a terrible tragedy of a wasted worthless life. Most seem to accept Jiro\u2019s life as worth living, and many consider his an exemplary life. Yet let\u2019s imagine some variations on Jiro\u2019s life, and ask if they are also worth living.First, imagine that Jiro is not rich. He is still the very best, but he gives his sushi away. He has enough to eat, stays warm, and is healthy, but has few luxuries. But since he spends most of his time at the office, it probably doesn\u2019t make that much difference to his quality of life if he is rich or poor.Second, imagine someone with Jiro\u2019s unsurpassed skill, overwhelming dedication, and fascination with their work, except that this person makes plywood, not sushi. Would that also be a life worth living? It would be a lower status life, as our culture lauds sushi chefs more than plywood makers. But he would still be the very best plywood maker in the world. Isn\u2019t that enough?Third, imagine holding constant this person\u2019s skill, while increasing other workers\u2019 skills, so that this person is now only of median quality. His subjective experience of working on the job would be similar, except he couldn\u2019t feel superior to everyone else. Would his life be worth living then? That is, can status by itself make the difference between a life worth living and one not? If when he isn\u2019t noticing his status, he has the same feeling of flow, immersion, and fascination in his work, wouldn\u2019t that be enough for a life worth living?Some of you probably see where I am going with this. Imagine we take the few hundred very best most dedicated workaholic humans, and fill a world with trillions of em copies of them, so that they are mostly working at near subsistence wages, yet have enough food, warmth, health, etc. Is this a world full of creatures with lives worth living?","155":" Overconfident Evaluation  I usually read the entire Washington Post, but apparently I didn\u2019t notice last Sunday\u2019s best article, about how top violinist Josh Bell played hauntingly beautiful music incognito in the subway and got $32 in donations (plus $20 from someone who recognized him), substantially less than the $150 predicted by the National Symphony Orchestra music director.  The lesson Tyler Cowen draws is \"most people are ninnies, with little or no taste,\" but for me the lesson is how we vastly overestimate our evaluation abilities.   Tyler more relevantly asks:If James Joyce were blogging today, without benefit of celebrity, and producing prose of the highest order, how many hits would he get a day?Surely the answer is: hardly any.  If we passed a super-model on the street, we would just think her another pretty face.  We employers overemphasize job interviews in part from overconfidence in our evaluation abilities.  We academics review papers, not realizing how little our evaluations correlate with one another.  We lovers are way too sure that our mate is the best person around for us. Fellow contributor Nick Bostrom is a philosophy star, and I have the greatest respect for him.  But sadly, I was not particularly impressed for the first few years I knew him.  I may well not recognize a genius who comments here either.  I was once indignant that few recognized my potential when I was young, but I now see how unreasonable that was. We do not like to admit how terribly dependent we are on imperfect and noisy social institutions to evaluate one another.  We like to think our institutions just confirm the obvious.  For example, academic stars usually feel confident that all the good people have been recognized; but surely that is very wrong. The main lesson is that we underestimate the importance of our evaluation institutions, and so should devote more effort to improving them.  I\u2019d love to create prediction markets to estimate the expected publication record of new academic hires.  This should improve our estimates, though estimates would probably vary a lot less across candidates than we expect.","156":" My Market Board Game  From roughly 1989 to 1992, I explored the concept of prediction markets (which I then called \u201cidea futures\u201d) in part via building and testing a board game. I thought I\u2019d posted details on my game before, but searching I couldn\u2019t find anything. So here is my board game.The basic idea is simple: people bet on \u201cwho done it\u201d while watching a murder mystery. So my game is an add-on to a murder mystery movie or play, or a game like How to Host a Murder. While watching the murder mystery, people stand around a board where they can reach in with their hands to directly and easily make bets on who done it. Players start with the same amount of money, and in the end whoever has the most money wins (or maybe wins in proportion to their winnings).Together with Ron Fischer (now deceased) I tested this game a half-dozen times with groups of about a dozen. People understood it quickly and easily, and had fun playing. I looked into marketing the game, but was told that game firms do not listen to proposals by strangers, as they fear being sued later if they came out with a similar game. So I set the game aside.All I really need to explain here is how mechanically to let people bet on who done it. First, you give all players 200 in cash, and from then on they have access to a \u201cbank\u201d where they can always make \u201cchange\u201d:Poker chips of various colors can represent various amounts, like 1, 5, 10, 25, or 100. In addition, you make similar-sized cards that read things like \u201cPays 100 if Andy is guilty.\u201d There are different cards for different suspects in the murder mystery, each suspect with a different color card. The \u201cbank\u201d allows exchanges like trading two 5 chips for one 10 chip, or trading 100 in chips for a set of all the cards, one for each suspect.Second, you make a \u201cmarket board\u201d, which is an array of slots, each of which can hold either chips or a card. If there were six suspects, an initial market board could look like this:For this board, each column is about one of the six suspects, and each row is about one of these ten prices: 5,10,15,20,25,30,40,50,60,80. Here is a blow-up of one slot in the array:Every slot holds either the kind of card for that column, or it holds the amount of chips for that row. The one rule of trading is: for any slot, anyone can swap the right card for the right amount of chips, or can make the opposite swap, depending on what is in the slot at the moment. The swap must be immediate; you can\u2019t put your hand over a slot to reserve it while you get your act together.This could be the market board near the end of the game:Here the players have settled on Pam as most likely to have done it, and Fred as least likely. At the end, players compute their final score by combining their cash in chips with 100 for each winning card; losing cards are worth nothing. And that\u2019s the game!For the initial board, fill a row with chips when the number of suspects times the price for that row is less than 100, and fill that row with cards otherwise. Any number of suspects can work for the columns, and any ordered set of prices between 0 and 100 can work for the rows. I made my boards by taping together clear-color M512 boxes from Tap Plastics, and taping printed white paper on tops around the edge.Added 30Aug: Here are a few observations about game play. 1) Many, perhaps most, players were so engaged by \u201cday trading\u201d in this market that they neglected to watch and think enough about the murder mystery. 2) You can allow players to trade directly with each other, but players show little interest in doing this. 3) Players found it more natural to buy than to sell. As a result, prices drifted upward, and often the sum of the buy prices for all the suspects was over 100. An electronic market maker could ensure that such arbitrage opportunities never arise, but in this mechanical version some players specialized in noticing and correcting this error.Added 31Aug: A twitter poll picked a name for this game: Murder, She Bet.Added 9Sep: Expert gamer Zvi Mowshowitz gives a detailed analysis of this game. He correctly notes that incentives for accuracy are lower in the endgame, though I didn\u2019t notice substantial problems with endgame accuracy in the trials I ran.","157":" It\u2019s Called \u201cStock\u201d  There\u2019s something the federal government can do right now to help students caught by our terribly unjust higher-education financing system. \u2026 Under an income-contingent loan system, \u2026 students pay a fixed percentage of their income toward their loans. Payments are automatically deducted from their paychecks by the IRS. .. After an extended time period of 20 or 30 years, any remaining debt is forgiven. \u2026 The concept has been proven to work\u2014Australia and Britain have used it for years\u2014 and \u2026 the Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman proposed the idea all the way back in 1955. \u2026Because student loans can almost never be discharged in bankruptcy, defaulted loans can haunt students for a lifetime. \u2026 That is insane. A similar-sounding federal program, called income-based repayment, is now on the books and is scheduled to become somewhat more generous starting in 2014. But the program is administratively complicated, involving income-eligibility caps and requiring students to reapply every year. (more)Yup, it can be easier to fund investments via \u201cloans\u201d whose repayment amounts are set to be a proportion the venture\u2019s net income. This is usually called \u201cstock,\u201d however, and proposals for private sector stock in individual future income are usually criticized as \u201cslavery.\u201d Especially if such stock claims on income are exempt from the usual bankruptcy evasions. But to most folks the same policy doesn\u2019t seem like slavery if the government does it, just like we refuse to call conscription slavery.Some argue that the government needs to make student loans because private loan markets fail in this case. But if they fail, it is mainly because we purposely hobble private investors by not allowing them the tools we are allow governments to ensure a return on their investment. This is how a lot of market failures go these days \u2013 they are real failures, but failures caused in large part by refusing to allow private actors all the tools we allow governments.","158":" A City Is A Village Of Villages  There have been three major eras of human history: foraging, farming, and industry. During each era our economy has grown at a roughly steady exponential rate, and I\u2019ve written before about some intriguing patterns in these growth eras: eras encompassed a similar number of doublings (~7-10), transitions between eras were much shorter than prior doubling times, and such transitions encompassed a similar number of growth rate doublings (~6-8). I\u2019ve also noted that transition-induced inequality seems to have fallen over time.I just noticed another intriguing pattern, this time in community sizes. Today in industrial societies roughly half of the population lives in metropolitan areas with between one hundred thousand and ten million people, with a mid size of about a million. While good data seems hard to find, during the farming era most people seem to have lived in communities (usually centered around a village) of between roughly three hundred and three thousand people, with a mid size of about a thousand. Foragers typically lived in mobile bands of size roughly twenty to fifty, with a best size of about thirty.So community sizes went roughly from thirty to a thousand to a million. The pattern here is that each new era had a typical community size that was roughly the square of the size during the previous era. That is, a city is roughly a village of villages, and a village is roughly a band of bands. We could extend this patter further if we liked, saying that an extended family group has about four to eight members, with a mid size of six, so that a band is a family of families. (We might even go further and say that a family is a couple of couples, where a couple has two or so members.)If previous growth patterns were to continue, I\u2019ve written before that a new growth era might appear sometime in roughly the next century, and over a few years the economy would transition to a new growth rate of doubling every week to month. If this newly-noticed community size pattern were to continue, the new era would have communities of size roughly a trillion, perhaps ranging from ten billion to a hundred trillion.Admittedly, after a year or two of this new era, things might change again, to yet another era. And the growth and community size trends couldn\u2019t both continue to that next era, since a community size of a trillion trillion would require much more than twenty doublings of growth. So these trends clearly have to break down at some point.I\u2019ve been exploring a particular scenario for this new era: it might be enabled and dominated by brain emulations, or \u201cems.\u201d Interestingly, I had already estimated an em community size of roughly a trillion based on other considerations. Ems could take up much less physical space than do humans, and since ems could visit each other in virtual reality without moving physically, em community sizes would be less limited by travel congestion costs.So what should one call a city of cities of a trillion souls? A \u201cworld\u201d?","159":" Are Showoff Men Cads?  This psych experiment is just begging to be tested on non-WEIRD (elite US college student) subjects:The present experiments demonstrate that the motivation to conspicuously consume and display, to the extent that it is evoked by a mating context, may be most prominent among men pursuing a sexual strategy that involves low parental investment. Conspicuous consumption was pronounced among men interested in short-term mating liaisons and was perceived accordingly by women. (more)There\u2019s an awful lot of conspicuous consumption around the world and across history.  And it is pretty hard for even close observers to tell if any given consumption is in a \u201cmating context.\u201d Shall we thus presume that most visible consumption by men is a bid for short term mating? For many societies, that seems to require higher levels of short term mating that is usually assumed.This seems a hypothesis to consider regarding the quite conspicuous consumption of farming elites. Was most elite male consumption mainly to help them attract commoner females into low commitment sex?  Bill Dickens and I assumed high rates of such sex in our proposed explanation for why rich societies have fewer kids \u2013 the prospect of having very fertile sons is what drives the big gains to women from delaying having kids to seek higher status.","160":" Clever Controls  Today\u2019s man-machine poker contest has a clever way to avoid random chance errors:The Alberta researchers have endowed the $50,000 contest with an ingenious design, making this the first man-machine contest to eliminate the luck of the draw as much as possible.Laak will play with a partner, fellow pro Ali Eslami. The two will be in separate rooms, and their games will be mirror images of one another, with Eslami getting the cards that the computer received in its hands against Laak, and vice versa.That way, a lousy hand for one human player will result in a correspondingly strong hand for his partner in the other room. At the end of the tournament the chips of both humans will be added together and compared to the computer\u2019s.Doubles tournaments based on this method could be made for lots of games with chance elements.","161":" School Attitudes  In forming my view that school functions in part to help folks accept workplace domination, I rediscovered the view of the \u201976 book Schooling In Capitalist America:Schools produce future workers; \u2026 schools socialize students to accept beliefs, values, and forms of behavior on the basis of authority rather than the students\u2019 own critical judgement of their interests.(Weakly) supporting evidence:A recent survey of 3,000 employers \u2026 asked, \u201cWhen you consider hiring a new nonsupervisory or production worker, how important are the following in your decision to hire?\u201d Employers ranked \u201cindustry based skill credentials\u201d at 3.2 on a scale of 1 (unimportant) to 5 (very important), with \u201cyears of schooling\u201d at 2.9, \u201cscore on tests given by employer\u201d and \u201cacademic performance\u201d both at 2.5. By far the most important was \u201cattitude\u201d ranked 4.6, followed by \u201ccommunication skills\u201d (4.2). \u2026[In a] survey of 1693 British employers \u2026 Of the somewhat more than a third of the establishments reporting a \u201cskill shortage\u201d, personnel managers identi\ufb01ed the recruitment problem as \u201clack of technical skills\u201d in 43 percent of the cases, but \u201cpoor attitude, motivation, or personality\u201d in a remarkable 62 percent of the cases. Poor attitude was by far the most important reason for the recruitment dif\ufb01culty given. The importance of motivation relative to technical skill was even greater among the full sample.Here\u2019s one accounting of three more specific functions of school:Legitimization: Repeated contacts with the educational system, which seems impersonal and based on reliable criteria, convinces students (and their parents) that they are ending up in an appropriate place in society based on their skills and abilities. Thus, people accept their position in life: they become resigned to it, maybe even considering it appropriate or fair.Acclimatization: The social relationships in the schools encourage certain traits, appropriate to one\u2019s expected economic position, while discouraging others. Thus,certain relationships are considered normal and appropriate. Subordination to authority is a dominant trait enforced for most students.Stratification: Students from different class backgrounds, races, ethnicities, and genders are overwhelmingly exposed to different environments and social relationships and thus are tracked and prepared for different positions in the hierarchy. The different experiences and successes lead each student to see her place as appropriate.","162":" Blogging Doubts  I continue to have doubts about whether to blog.  As I explained in February, my main doubt is whether this will accumulate:A newspaper or magazine article will be read by thousands, while one is lucky if ten people read an academic paper.  So if you want influence, write for the popular media, right?  Well, those thousands of newspaper readers will soon forget everything you said, but a few academic readers may well write papers influenced by your paper.  People almost never look up ten year old newspaper columns, but they do often read ten year old academic papers.  So an academic paper may still have a better chance at long term influence than a newspaper column.Yes, we get over a thousand readers a day here, and those readers must be influenced somehow.  But do those influences add up to a long term net effect?Consider that before the farming revolution humanity\u2019s knowledge accumulated very slowly.  Each person learned a great deal over the course of his lifetime, both by discovering new insights for himself and by listening to others.  Nevertheless, the distribution of knowledge in the population hardly changed; each new generation had to rediscover and relearn the same insights all over again.So the fact that each blogger and reader today feels like he is slowly gaining insight does not mean we are part of a process by which humanity accumulates insight.  We could just each be relearning and re-expressing what many of our ancestors knew.  Of course parts of academia may also fall victim to the same syndrome.  But it seems that at least some parts of academia do manage to accumulate insight via modularity.  As I said:A key difference is that academics organize into a network of specialists with social norms requiring them to cite related previous work, and to situate their publications so that they can be found by others working on similar topics.The joy of blogging for me is taking just an hour to pen and distribute an apparently powerful insight.  But this joy is illusory if my insights never join a process of accumulation where others build on my insights and integrate them effectively into a larger body of thought.  If I\u2019m mainly the equivalent of a newspaper columnist, rather than a part of a community of modular thinkers, this is to me a waste. So, given that these are my goals and concerns, should I quit blogging in favor of more traditional academic publications?","163":" Construction Peaks At 60Hr\/Wk  Yesterday I puzzled over:I have found many studies, conducted by businesses, universities, industry associations and the military, that support the basic notion that, for most people, eight hours a day, five days per week, is the best sustainable long-term balance point between output and exhaustion. Throughout the 30s, 40s, and 50s, these studies were apparently conducted by the hundreds. \u2026 Somehow, Silicon Valley didn\u2019t get the memo. \u2026 Five-day weeks of eight-hour days maximize long-term output in every industry that has been studied over the past century. (more)The most recent study this cites is from \u201980 on construction. But I just dug a bit deeper, found some recent papers, and I can now say that this claim is just wrong, at least for construction.First, an \u201901 review found total product peaking at 60 hours per weak:Now some claim that added product only comes in the first few weeks of long hours, after which exhaustion sets in. But an \u201905 paper looked at 88 long construction projects, many over fifteen weeks duration, and it still found max product at 60 hr\/wk. Also, an \u201911 paper gives an integrated model that explicitly includes exhaustion effects, and it also has max product at 60 hr\/wk.So averaging over many construction projects, and including long-run exhaustion effects, total product tends to be highest at sixty hours of work per week. This leaves plenty of room for higher hours-per-week peaks 1) for especially hardy individuals, and 2) in less physically demanding industries.","164":" Sports Signals  Sports leagues are cracking down hard on athletes who look smug after making a good play.  Football:A crackdown on excessive touchdown celebrations \u2026 has moved from the National Football League to college football and now to high school football games across the country.  In the Washington area this fall, a wide receiver from 13th-ranked McNamara was flagged for pointing to the sky after a touchdown, and a Gwynn Park defender was penalized for pointing up at the sky after intercepting a pass. \u2026 \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is in the old days, there was a certain level of celebration that was allowed. Now it\u2019s basically no celebration,\u201d \u2026There are some who view the crackdown as necessary \u2014 ridding the high school game of the scripted Sharpie-in-the-sock, cellphone-in-the-goalpost-padding type of touchdown celebrations that first appeared in the NFL a few years ago. \u2026 The cleanup of those routines earned the NFL a new nickname \u2014 the No Fun League \u2026 How far can you go before you take the joy out of the sport?\u2026  Federation rule 9-5-1 \u2026 reads, in part: \u201cunsportsmanlike manner \u2026 Any delayed, excessive or prolonged act by which a player attempts to focus attention upon himself.\u201dBasketball:Under a new zero-tolerance policy approved by the NCAA, penalizing excessive celebrations will be a point of emphasis this season. The regulation has left coaches \u2026 concerned that one of their sport\u2019s most marketable aspects \u2014 its raw emotion \u2014 is being legislated out of the game. \u2026According to ACC officiating supervisor John Clougherty \u2026 the crackdown on excessive celebrations is meant to deter players from showing up or embarrassing a member of the opposing team.  Among the actions Clougherty said will be closely monitored are pointing, gesturing \u2026\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be tough for all the players, especially when somebody gets dunked on,\u201d said Maryland guard Greivis Vasquez, who\u2019s been known to be excitable on the court from time to time. \u201cYou going to just keep your emotions in or you going to say nothing? You just going to be like this [stone-faced]? It\u2019s going to be hard.Organized sports exist in large part to let athletes look good by winning, and to let fans affiliate with winners.  Athletes commonly call attention to their wins via trophies, rings, team jerseys, score boards, etc.  So how can it be offensive for players to have a little fun by calling attention to their winning plays during a game?That last quote by Vasquez gets at the key, I think: when it is hard not to brag, not bragging is more impressive than bragging.   Since we want our athletes to be impressive, we want them not to brag.  We don\u2019t mind athletes having fun, but not fun that makes them seem less impressive.","165":" Innovation Levers  Innovation is terribly important; it is why we are rich.  We know innovation is caused by economic activity, but if we knew which activities more promoted innovation, we\u2019d want to subsidize them.  Three recent papers suggests we should prefer many small industries each dominated by a few firms, and prefer private research in processes of capital intensive industries, especially chem\/drug and comp\/electronics.First, a review article says R&D spending is more effective for process over product, private over public, and basic over applied:A distinction is made between R&D directed toward invention of new methods of production (process R&D) and R&D directed towards the creation of new and improved goods (product R&D). \u2026 Most studies find a higher rate of return for process as compared to product R&D.  \u2026 A lower rate of return (or a less significant one) is reported by many authors to public rather than private R&D, both at the private and social level \u2026 A higher return is also generally reported on basic R&D as opposed to applied or development. \u2026 Social returns, these are almost always estimated to be substantially greater than the private returns.Second, it seems that larger firms are just less efficient at research, especially in drugs and electronics:While the empirical literature fails to generate a consensus view, a number of studies report that the patent yield from R&D expenditures falls with firm size.Third, Shawn Miller, a student in my I\/O class last semester, did a great paper predicting patents by industry.  He found more (patent) innovation in industries that are smaller, more capital intensive, and more concentrated among a few firms.  Chemical, computer, drug, and electronic industries were especially innovative.  Here is Miller\u2019s main table:","166":"1 Karnataka Hospital Insurance Experiment  In 2008 I posted on the famous RAND Health Insurance Experiment:1974 to 1982 the US government spent $50 million to randomly assign 7700 people in six US cities to three to five years each of either free or not free medicine, provided by the same set of doctors. \u2026 people randomly given free medicine in the late 1970s consumed 30-40% more medical services, paid one more \u201crestricted activity day\u201d per year to deal with the medical system, but were not noticeably healthier! (More, see also)I got 60 signatures on a petition then for the \u201cUS to publicly conduct a similar experiment again soon, this time with at least ten thousand subjects treated for at least ten years\u201d.In 2011 I posted on the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment:Oregon assigned a limited number of available Medicaid slots by lottery. \u2026 8,704 (~30%) [very sick and poor US adults] were enrolled in Medicaid medical insurance. \u2026 at most see two years worth of data. \u2026 had substantially and significantly better self-reported health. \u2026 over two thirds of the health gains \u2026 appeared on the very first survey, done before lottery winners got additional medical treatment. (More)No statistically significant effect on measures of blood pressure, cholesterol, or blood sugar. \u2026 did not reduce the predicted risk of a cardiovascular event within ten years and did not significantly change the probability that a person was a smoker or obese. \u2026 it reduced observed rates of depression by 30 percent. (More)Today I report on the new Karnataka Hospital Insurance Experiment:This study \u2026 is amongst the largest health insurance experiments ever conducted \u2026 in Karnataka, which spans south to central India. The sample included 10,879 households (comprising 52,292 members) in 435 villages. Sample households were above the poverty line \u2026 and lacked other [hospital] insurance. \u2026 randomized to one of 4 treatments: free RSBY [= govt hospital] insurance, the opportunity to buy RSBY insurance, the opportunity to buy plus an unconditional cash transfer equal to the RSBY premium, and no intervention. \u2026 intervention lasted from May 2015 to August 2018. \u2026Opportunity to purchase insurance led to 59.91% uptake and access to free insurance to 78.71% uptake. \u2026 Across a range of health measures, we estimate no significant impacts on health. \u2026 We conducted a baseline survey involving multiple members of each household 18 months before the intervention. We measured outcomes two times, at 18 months and at 3.5 years post intervention. \u2026 only 3 (0.46% of all estimated coefficients concerning health outcomes) were significant after multiple-testing adjustments. We cannot reject the hypothesis that the distribution of p-values from these estimates is consistent with no differences (P=0.31). (more)So a new randomized experiment on ordinary health residents of India had 6.8x as many subjects as the RAND experiment, and also found no net effect on health. It only looked at the effects of hospital treatment, but to many that is the crown jewel of medicine.Bottom line: we now have more stronger data that on average, more medicine doesn\u2019t improve health. Though of course for people committed to buying useless medicine insurance can cut financial stress. Update your beliefs accordingly.","167":" Dinos on the Moon  At the SETI conference last week I was surprised to hear NASA\u2019s Chris McKay suggest we look for dinosaur relics on the moon.  Dinos went suddenly extinct about 65M years ago, and the dino fossil record seems spotty enough that we could have missed a lineage that went from possum to human sized brains in the ~10M year period it took mammals.  We could also have missed relics of a stone-tool phase that lasted only .2M years.  But a dino lander left on the moon should stay visible a very long time. Humans have apparently already dug up a substantial fraction of the richest near-surface Earth metal deposits.  So a dino civilization that went much beyond our metal usage would have left a signature in reduced rich metal deposits.  And since the metal doesn\u2019t actually disappear, they would also have left \"strange\" metal-junkyard deposits.  If modest efforts by geologists could exclude this possibility, that seems well worth the effort. It would be very big and bad news to hear that metal-using dinos suddenly went extinct just when the other dinos did, and immediately after becoming big metal users.  If so, either dinos destroyed themselves with far more power than we humans can now muster, or powerful aliens exterminated them.From McKay\u2019s 1996 paper \"Time for intelligence on other planets\":It is now considered probable that the dinosaurs were not the lumbering clods of urban myth but that they were biochemically and behaviorally as sophisticated as present mammals.   Evidence continues to point to parentling and social behavior that is on a par wit small mammals and birds.   \u2026  [Considero] the small carnivorous dinosaur Stenonychosaurus, which stood about 120cm, weighed about 40 kg, and had [a brain size ratio] about equal to that of a possum or an octopus, and lived over 12 million years before the end of the dinosaurs.  \u2026One might speculate that perhaps Stenonychosaurus or her progeny did build radio telescopes, but their civilization was destroyed by some internal or external catastrophe.  Perhaps the lifetime of their civilization was so short compared with the resolution of the geological record (typically millions of years) that it is simply lost without a trace in the depths of time.  It is difficult to say what evidence would survive of human civilization \u2013 if it was terminated now \u2013 after 65 million years of tectonic activity, erosion, and sea level change.  It is interesting to note that there is one place where the record of human technology will be preserved for times much longer than 100 million years.  \u2026 The Apollo landing sites on the Moon would bear mute testimony to technological humans.","168":" My Cryonics Hour  To encourage people to sign up for cryonics, I've offered to debate influential bloggers on the subject.  Spurred by recent successes, and failures, I'll up the ante:I hereby offer to talk for one hour on any subject to anyone who can show me they've newly signed up for cryonics.  You can record the conversation, publish it, and can sell your time to someone else. Yes, I know, this may not exactly be a huge incentive to most people, but its what I have to offer.

Most democratic systems are pretty simple. To a first approximation, anyone can run for office, any adult citizen can vote, and voters can use all their usual ways to associate and talk to evaluate and coordinate on who to vote for in upcoming elections.Imagine that some academics instead develop and advocate for a \u201ccurated\u201d system of democracy. They research how democratic outcomes vary with the candidates, who votes on which candidates, and who talks to who about which candidates and topics. These academics say that if you put someone who knows this literature well in charge of \u201ccurating\u201d democracy, you can get better outcomes.Assume that these researchers have the usual level of academic competence at doing their research. They study a real phenomena and make real progress, but have the usual academic biases, such as playing usual games of hindering rivals via insider clubs and method fashions. Their results tend to be complex, though news media can sometimes offer deceptively simple summaries of them.How eager are you to replace your simple democratic system with a voting system curated by an expert credentialed by these academics? That is, to put these curators in charge of who can run for office, who can vote on what, and who can talk to who how about what political topics? They wouldn\u2019t suggest simple rules that we could then debate and choose whether to adopt. No, they\u2019d make many detailed context-dependent choices that they couldn\u2019t well explain to us; we\u2019d just have to trust them.Most of us wouldn\u2019t trust them, and thus would be wary of such curated democracy. Because democracy is less about having a well-oiled machine and more about having a simple neutral system that we can trust when we don\u2019t together trust any particular people that much to run our system.This is how I feel about the forecasting systems and contests that are now popular among academics, relative to simple prediction markets. In a simple prediction market, you set up a topic on which to bet cash, and then let any individual or group bet cash there at any time, in any amount, and the current price is your best estimate. Biases are to be fixed by traders profiting from finding and correcting them. Yes, each market has some mechanical details, but those matter less when there is lots of trading, and it usually works okay to let people compete to pick details of the markets they pay to create.In contrast, in curated prediction contests, the curators pick who participates on which questions, assign them to teams in which they work together, assign them each a weight in a final consensus function that they choose, say how and in what units each is rewarded as a function of their predictions and outcomes, adjust their consensus for various \u201cbiases\u201d they see. Curators say that in their studies that this approach gives more accurate predictions.Which may well be true. Except they don\u2019t do the crucial test where a lot is at stake in the decisions that the markets influence, so much that interested parties try to corrupt the curators themselves. By bribing curators, threatening to get them fired, or just taking over the whole process by which they are trained and selected. The more details that curators control, and the harder to understand their reasons for making adjustments, the more room there\u2019d be for curator corruption.Institution\/system\/mechanism design is a very different problem between when (a) you can trust someone to run it, and make discretionary adjustments as needed, and (b) there is no one we can agree to trust, so we need to agree on something simple and clear that will run with few such adjustments. I\u2019m most interested in that second kind of design problem.","170":" Econ Neglects Licensing  Labor economics is economists studying work and employment.  The latest Econ Journal Watch has an article suggesting distorted priorities in labor econ texts.  In the U.S. now, less than 3% of workers earn the minimum wage, about 12% are in unions, and about 29% are required to hold a state-issued license to do their work.  But here are the priorities of \u201cfive undergraduate labor economics textbooks currently in print. \u2026 All but one have been published in four or more editions\u201d:Here is my relevant theory paper, here are some sample licensed jobs,and here are more informative quotes from the EJW article:Kleiner and Krueger (2008) find that licensing is associated with a 15 percent wage premium. \u2026 Pfeffer (1974) who finds a negative relationship between the ease of licensing and income of accountants, attorneys, barbers, dentists, and pharmacists, though he finds no such correlation for real estate agents. Similarly, Kleiner and Kudrle (2000) find that tougher licensing requirements for dentists raise practitioners\u2019 incomes. Timmons and Thornton (2008a) conclude that radiologic technologists in states with licensing earn as much as much as 6.9 percent more than those working in states without licensing; Timmons and Thornton (2008b, 141) find that \u201ccertain licensing provisions may have increased the earnings of barbers by as much as 26 percent.\u201d \u2026Examining the real estate market, Johnson and Loucks (1986) conclude that licensing regulations result in better service for consumers. In contrast, Carroll and Gaston (1981, 973) report that \u201cconsistently from occupation to occupation [among the seven they studied] there existed a strong negative association between per capita numbers of an occupation and measures of per capita quality of service received\u201d \u2026 Kleiner and Todd\u2019s (2007) \u2026 [show] tighter state bonding\/net worth requirements for mortgage brokers is associated with higher foreclosure rates and a greater percentage of high interest mortgages. \u2026 Kleiner and Kudrle (2000) study the dental health of air Force recruits and find recruits from states with more stringent dentist licensing standards do not have better dental health than recruits from states with lower standards. Similarly, Skarbek (2008, 71) analyzes Florida\u2019s relaxation of restrictions on construction contractors in the wake of Hurricanes Frances and Katrina and finds \u201clittle evidence of significant detrimental effects from the policy change\u201d \u2026 Paul (1984) finds no evidence that states licensing physicians experienced higher quality care as measured by mortality rates.","171":" Who\/What Should Get Votes?  Alex T. asks Should the Future Get a Vote? He dislikes suggestions to give more votes to \u201ccivic organizations\u201d who claim to represent future folks, since prediction markets could be more trustworthy:Through a suitable choice of what is to be traded, prediction markets can be designed to be credibly motivated by a variety of goals including the interests of future generations. \u2026 If all we cared about was future GDP, a good rule would be to pass a policy if prediction markets estimate that future GDP will be higher with the policy than without the policy. Of course, we care about more than future GDP; perhaps we also care about environmental quality, risk, inequality, liberty and so forth. What Hanson\u2019s futarchy proposes is to incorporate all these ideas into a weighted measure of welfare. \u2026 Note, however, that even this assumes that we know what people in the future will care about. Here then is the final meta-twist. We can also incorporate into our measure of welfare predictions of how future generations will define welfare. (more)For example, we could implement a 2% discount rate by having official welfare be 2% times welfare this next year plus 98% times welfare however it will be defined a year from now. Applied recursively, this can let future folks keep changing their minds about what they care about, even future discount rates.We could also give votes to people in the past. While one can\u2019t change the experiences of past folks, one can still satisfy their preferences. If past folks expressed particular preferences regarding future outcomes, those preferences could also be given weight in an overall welfare definition.We could even give votes to animals. One way is to make some assumptions about what outcomes animals seem to care about, pick ways to measure such outcomes, and then include weights on those measures in the welfare definition. Another way is to assume that eventually we\u2019ll \u201cuplift\u201d such animals so that they can talk to us, and put weights on what those uplifted animals will eventually say about the outcomes their ancestors cared about.We might even put weights on aliens, or on angels. We might just put a weight on what they say about what they want, if they ever show up to tell us. If they never show up, those weights stay set at zero.Of course just because we could give votes to future folks, past folks, animals, aliens, and angels doesn\u2019t mean we will ever want to do so.","172":" I\u2019ll Be Different  A young colleague recently said he didn't want to end up like older folks he knew who didn't keep up with new music fashions.  Some of us older folks suggested he probably would become like us, and he would probably like it.  He was horrified.People often wonder what it will be like for them to be old, or married, or with a successful career, etc.  They usually conclude they just can't know, and must wait and see.  Yet all around them are other folks who are old, married, etc. \u2013 why not just accept those experiences as a good predictions of such futures? People usually respond that they are too different from these other folks for their experiences to be a good guide.  A paper in the latest Science suggests otherwise: Two experiments revealed that (i) people can more accurately predict their affective reactions to a future event when they know how a neighbor in their social network reacted to the event than when they know about the event itself and (ii) people do not believe this.We mistakenly prefer an \"inside\" view, imagining how we'd respond to particular details, but in fact the \"outside\" view of others' reactions is more reliable.  This seems to me more than a simple cognitive error.  It seems folks feel that they would not be motivated enough to exercise, marry, work, etc. if they thought their future was going to be much like the futures of others around them.  Are they right?  More from that paper:In two experiments, participants more accurately predicted their affective reactions to a future event when they knew how a neighbor in their social network had reacted to it than when they knew about the event itself. Women made more accurate predictions about how much they would enjoy a date with a man when they knew how much another woman in their social network enjoyed dating the man than when they read the man\u2019s personal profile and saw his photograph. Men and women made more accurate predictions about how they would feel after being evaluated by a peer when they knew how another person in their social network had felt after being evaluated than when they previewed the evaluation itself. Although surrogation trumped simulation, both participants and independent judges had precisely the opposite intuition. By a wide margin, they believed that simulation was more likely than surrogation to produce accurate affective forecasts.","173":" Academic Ideals  Academia doesn't live up to its noble image. Philosopher Peter Fosl: Although academics will hardly raise an eyebrow about this \"open secret,\" it comes as a surprise to many others to learn that many philosophers \u2026 are little devoted to the love of wisdom. In only a merely \"academic\" way do they aspire to intellectual virtue. Even less often do they exhibit qualities of moral excellence. On the contrary, many philosophers, or what pass as philosophers, are, sadly, better described as petty social climbers, meretricious snobs, and acquisitive consumerists.  I blush a bit now to confess that part of what drove me into philosophy in the first place was the naive conviction that among those who call themselves lovers of wisdom I would find something different in kind from the repugnant and shallow brutalism of the worlds of finance, business, and the law.  \u2026Having read the repudiations of wealth in Plato, the Epicureans, and Augustine; having read about moderation and restraint in Cicero, Spinoza, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein; and having accepted the low pay rates of the academy, philosophers ought to be, I concluded, the sort of people whose contempt for money and status would be matched only by the purity and passion of their engagement with reasoning, theorising, contemplation, and speculation. Alas.  Instead, I've found that the secret lives of philosophers are more often than not pre-occupied with status and acquisition. \u2026 Like debutantes at the ball, philosophers now often spend much of their time dropping names, gossiping, promoting their connections, hawking their publications. \u2026 Like a member of the admissions committee to a fancy country club, a colleague \u2026 told me [his department] wouldn't even consider hiring a newly minted PhD who hadn't graduated from a program \"ranked\" in at least the top fifteen;\u2026 applications from candidates not in the top fifteen aren't even read. \u2026Philosophers seem to pepper their conversations more and more with remarks about the perks or bonuses they receive \u2013 how much money they have available for travel, what sort of computer allowances, how big their research grants are. \u2026 Academic conferences increasingly offer sumptuous banquets, musical entertainment, guided tours of local attractions, and well-stocked bars. \u2026 Even as they preach tiresome denunciations of privilege and power formulated in the language of Foucault and critical theory, academics now flee or aspire to flee to institutions where status and money pool.  Finding philosophers devoted principally to the love of wisdom and to sharing it broadly has become, as Spinoza said of all excellent things, as difficult as it is rare.Of course athletes, actors, authors, artists, musicians, preachers, activists, and politicians often similarly fail to live up to their ideal images.  But such communities do try somewhat to coordinate to discourage overly-obvious contradictions between image and reality.  Which suggests many questions.Do some of these groups try harder than others to live up to their images, and if so why?  If these contradictions were somehow made more obvious to the public, how far would these communities be go to reduce them?  If they did nothing, would they be displaced by substitutes?I suspect most who support and affiliate with academia only care a little about academia's aspiring to intellectual virtue, and little would change if we had more obvious image-reality contradictions.  But I'd like to be wrong.  Or are we somehow better off under hypocrisy?  Hat tip to Richard Chappell.","174":" Signal Mappers Decouple  Andrew Sullivan notes that Tim Lee argues that ems (whole brain emulations) just won\u2019t work:There\u2019s no reason to think it will ever be possible to scan the human brain and create a functionally equivalent copy in software. Hanson \u2026 fails to grasp that the emulation of one computer by another is only possible because digital computers are the products of human designs, and are therefore inherently easier to emulate than natural systems. \u2026 Digital computers \u2026 were built by a human being based on a top-down specification that explicitly defines which details of their operation are important. The spec says exactly which aspects of the machine must be emulated and which aspects may be safely ignored. This matters because we don\u2019t have anywhere close to enough hardware to model the physical characteristics of digital machines in detail. Rather, emulation involves re-implementing the mathematical model on which the original hardware was based. Because this model is mathematically precise, the original device can be perfectly replicated.You can\u2019t emulate a natural system because natural systems don\u2019t have designers, and therefore weren\u2019t built to conform to any particular mathematical model. \u2026 Creating a simulation of a natural system inherently means means making judgment calls about which aspects of a physical system are the most important. And because there\u2019s no underlying blueprint, these guesses are never perfect: it will always be necessary to leave out some details that affect the behavior of the overall system, which means that simulations are never more than approximately right. Weather simulations, for example, are never going to be able to predict precisely where each raindrop will fall, they only predict general large-scale trends, and only for a limited period of time. \u2026 We may have relatively good models for the operation of nerves, but these models are simplifications, and therefore they will differ in subtle ways from the operation of actual nerves. And these subtle micro-level inaccuracies will snowball into large-scale errors when we try to simulate an entire brain, in precisely the same way that small micro-level imperfections in weather models accumulate to make accurate long-range forecasting inaccurate. \u2026 Each neuron is itself a complex biological system. I see no reason to think we\u2019ll ever be able to reduce it to a mathematically tractable model. (more; Eli Dourado agrees; Alex Waller disagrees.)Human brains were not designed by humans, but they were designed. Evolution has imposed huge selection pressures on brains over millions of years, to perform very particular functions. Yes, humans use more math that does natural selection to assist them. But we should expect brain emulation to be feasible because brains function to process signals, and the decoupling of signal dimensions from other system dimensions is central to achieving the function of a signal processor. The weather is not a designed signal processor, so it does not achieve such decoupling. Let me explain.A signal processor is designed to mantain some intended relation between particular inputs and outputs. All known signal processors are physical systems with vastly more degrees of freedom than are contained in the relevant inputs they seek to receive, the outputs they seek to send, or the sorts of dependencies between input and outputs they seek to maintain. So in order manage its intended input-output relation, a signal processor simply must be designed to minimize the coupling between its designed input, output, and internal channels, and all of its other \u201cextra\u201d physical degrees of freedom. Really, just ask most any signal-process hardware engineer.Now sometimes random inputs can be useful in certain signal processing strategies, and this can be implemented by coupling certain parts of the system to most any random degrees of freedom. So signal processors don\u2019t always want to minimize extra couplings. But this is a rare exception to the general need to decouple.The bottom line is that to emulate a biological signal processor, one need only identify its key internal signal dimensions and their internal mappings \u2013 how input signals are mapped to output signals for each part of the system. These key dimensions are typically a tiny fraction of its physical degrees of freedom. Reproducing such dimensions and mappings with sufficient accuracy will reproduce the function of the system.This is proven daily by the 200,000 people with artificial ears, and will be proven soon when artificial eyes are fielded. Artificial ears and eyes do not require a detailed weather-forecasting-like simulation of the vast complex physical systems that are our ears and eyes. Yes, such artificial organs do not exactly reproduce the input-output relations of their biological counterparts. I expect someone with one artificial ear and one real ear could tell the difference. But the reproduction is close enough to allow the artificial versions to perform most of the same practical functions.We are confident that the number of relevant signal dimensions in a human brain is vastly smaller than its physical degrees of freedom. But we do not know just how many are those dimensions. The more dimensions, the harder it will be to emulate them. But the fact that human brains continue to function with nearly the same effectiveness when they are whacked on the side of the head, or when flooded with various odd chemicals, shows they have been designed to decouple from most other physical brain dimensions.The brain still functions reasonably well even flooded with chemicals specifically designed to interfere with neurotransmitters, the key chemicals by which neurons send signals to each other! Yes people on \u201cdrugs\u201d don\u2019t function exactly the same, but with moderate drug levels people can still perform most of the functions required for most jobs.Remember, my main claim is that whole brain emulation will let machines substitue for humans through the vast majority of the world economy. The equivalent of human brains on mild drugs should be plenty sufficient for this purpose \u2013 we don\u2019t need exact replicas.Added 7p: Tim Lee responds:Hanson seems to be making a different claim here than he made in his EconTalk interview. There his claim seemed to be that we didn\u2019t need to understand how the brain works in any detail because we could simply scan a brain\u2019s neurons and \u201cport\u201d them to a silicon substrate. Here, in contrast, he\u2019s suggesting that we determine the brain\u2019s \u201ckey internal signal dimensions and their internal mappings\u201d and then build a digital system that replicates these higher-level functions. Which is to say we do need to understand how the brain works in some detail before we can duplicate it computationally. \u2026Biologists know a ton about proteins. \u2026 Yet despite all our knowledge, \u2026 general protein folding is believed to be computationally intractible. \u2026 My point is that even detailed micro-level knowledge of a system doesn\u2019t necessarily give us the capacity to efficiently predict its macro-level behavior. \u2026 By the same token, even if we had a pristine brain scan and a detailed understanding of the micro-level properties of neurons, there\u2019s no good reason to think that simulating the behavior of 100 billion neurons will ever be computationally tractable.My claim is that, in order to create economically-sufficient substitutes for human workers, we don\u2019t need to understand how the brain works beyond having decent models of each cell type as a signal processor. Like the weather, protein folding is not designed to process signals and so does not have the decoupling feature I describe above. Brain cells are designed to process signals in the brain, and so should have a much simplified description in signal processing terms. We already have pretty good signal-processing models of some cell types; we just need to do the same for all the other cell types.","175":" Hide Sociobiology Like Sex?

In sending the young into life with such a false psychological orientation, education is behaving as though one were to equip people starting on a Polar expedition with summer clothing and maps of the Italian Lakes.Nevertheless, Barash prefers that we discuss self-interest as we do sex: too little too late:The teaching of sociobiology (or evolutionary psychology) should be undertaken only with great caution. The renowned primatologist Sarah Hrdy \u2026 questioned \"whether sociobiology should be taught at the high-school level \u2026 \u2026 The whole message of sociobiology is oriented toward the success of the individual. \u2026 Unless a student has a moral framework already in place, we could be producing social monsters by teaching this.\" \u2026 Preferable, I submit, is to structure the teaching of sociobiology along the lines of sex education: Teach what we know, but do so in age-appropriate stages. Just as we would not bombard kindergartners with the details of condom use, we probably ought not instruct preteens in the finer points of sociobiology.What reason does Barash give?There is an altruistic as well as a selfish side to the evolutionary coin. A half-baked introduction to the discipline, which pointed only to the latter, would therefore do students a substantial disservice. \u2026 Writes the gene theorist David Haig, \"\u2026 even though genes may cajole, deceive, cheat, swindle, or steal, \u2026 this does not mean that people must be similarly self-interested.\" \u2026 The real test of our humanity might be whether we are willing, at least on occasion, to say no to our \"natural\" inclinations, thereby refusing go along with our selfish genes. To my knowledge, no other animal species is capable of doing that.I\u2019m skeptical that humans are special in this way.  But more important, Barash fails to say why the possibility of such a special ability suggests that we should wait to teach children about self-interest.   It seems to me that Barash has failed here to otherwise rationalize his own apparently self-interested behavior in encouraging others to be \u201cunselfish suckers.\u201dNevertheless, the key question remains: what price do we pay, individually and socially, for overcoming bias?Hat tip to Keith Henson.Addendum:  I\u2019ve fixed the Freud quote, which was completely wrong.  Sigh.","176":" Congress Sells Secrets?  Compared to ordinary investors, US Congress members get huge returns on their investments, presumably via their inside line on upcoming government actions. In particular, Congress gets inside info on upcoming US-backed coups, and someone has been trading lots on that info.

Stock returns of highly exposed firms reacted to coup authorizations classified as top-secret. The average cumulative abnormal return to a coup authorization was 9% over 4 days for a fully nationalized company, rising to more than 13% over sixteen days. Pre-coup authorizations accounted for a larger share of stock price increases than the actual coup events themselves.

Even so, I doubt it is legal to trade stocks using top-secret info on planned coups, thereby leaking that info to the world.

In a series of experiments, researchers created situations in which people had less control over their situation, and then tested how likely the participants were to see imaginary images embedded in snowy pictures. The researchers also had participants write about either a situation in which they had control, or a situation in which they didn\u2019t, and then presented stories involving strange coincidences. People who had written about a situation in which they were not in control were more likely to draw non-existent connections between the coincidences, the researchers found.This summary suggests out-of-control-feeling folks are biased to see more than there is, but perhaps in-control-feeling folks are biased to see less than there is.","178":" Ancient Political Self-Deception  From Gene Expression:There are certain things which are sacred, certain lines you don\u2019t cross. \u2026 I was thinking about [this] a few months ago when I read Rome & Jerusalem: A Clash of Ancient Civilizations and God\u2019s Rule \u2013 Government and Islam.  You see, the ancient Romans and Muslims did not have kings. Kings were tyrants, and the early Roman and Islamic polities rejected such tyranny on principle. So of course, instead of kings, the Roman Empire was headed by an emperor, while the Muslims had caliphs. Get it? When Augustus defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra the official narrative was that the doughty republican traditions of Rome had bested once more the oriental despotism of the Hellenistic world, with their Greek kings and queens. Similarly, the righteous AbbasidsUmayyads. In its place they established a genuine Islamic state which was guided by the traditions of the community as opposed to profane naked autocracy. Right\u2026.As you can see here, the extent of the self-deception and semantic delusion is really humorous. Now, it is true that the early emperors of Rome tended to keep up the illusion that they were simply stewards of the Roman Republic with some verisimilitude. Augustus\u2019 shtick was that his was a restorationist project; he was no dictator or king, just the First Citizen. Similarly, the early Abbasids were ostensibly bringing the vision of the Islamic community to its true fulfillment (especially the Shia party), whereas the Umayyads had been worldly Arab tribalists more in keeping with the values of the jahiliya. \u2026 Muslim soldiers were enraged and shocked when the conqueror of Spain allowed his Visigothic wife to convince him to don a crown and so indicate kingship; they accused him of becoming a Christian.I\u2019ve been saying for years that people prefer democracy mainly because they think it raises their social status \u2013 being ruled by a king makes you lower status relative to people who \"rule themselves.\"  We can\u2019t quite fool ourselves into thinking a king is just a \"steward\", but we apparently can think we really rule because we elect our rulers.Added 2Apr:  Nazi Hermann G\u00f6ring:Oh, [democracy] is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.

[HT Caplan]","179":" Blame Victims For Lies  Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.Since gullible people tend to believe what they are told, other folks are more tempted to lie to them. So if one chooses to be gullible, one must accept a lot of responsibility for the lies one hears. Case in point: voters are greatly responsible for the lies their leaders tell them. A Post book review:The leaders most likely to lie are precisely those in Western democracies, those whose traditions of democracy perversely push them to mislead the very public that elected them. In fact \u2026 leaders tend to lie to their own citizens more often than they lie to each other. In his disheartening yet fascinating book, \u201cWhy Leaders Lie,\u201d Mearsheimer offers a treatise on the biggest of big fat lies, breaking down the deceptions the world\u2019s presidents and generals and strongmen engage in \u2014 when, why and how they lie, and how effective those falsehoods can be.First are \u201cinter-state lies,\u201d deceptions aimed at other countries to gain or retain some advantage over them. \u2026 Such state-to-state lies are relatively uncommon \u2026 and successful ones are even less so. In a world where each state must fend for itself, leaders are unlikely to take each other\u2019s word on serious stuff. \u2026 Also, if you lie too often, no one will trust you, so what\u2019s the point?\u2026 \u201cFearmongering\u201d \u2014 when leaders cannot convince the public of the threats they foresee and so deceive the people \u201cfor their own good\u201d \u2014 is far more prevalent and effective. \u2026Next is the \u201cstrategic cover-up,\u201d in which a leader misleads in order to cover up a policy that has gone badly wrong, or to hide a smart but potentially controversial strategy. \u2026 National myths fuel solidarity by putting a country\u2019s history in the best possible light. \u2026 Liberal lies \u2026 are used to justify odious behavior that conflicts with traditional ideals. For example, Winston Churchill and FDR served up a generous helping of deceit when depicting Stalin as a good guy (friendly ol\u2019 \u201cUncle Joe\u201d) to justify their cooperation with the Soviet leader during World War II. \u2026Depending on the situation, lies can be \u201cclever, necessary, and maybe even virtuous.\u201d \u2026 [But] widespread lying makes it harder for citizens to make good choices in the voting booth. \u2026. And in fragile democracies, pervasive lying can so alienate the public that they are willing to embrace more authoritarian leadership.Because voters tend to be gullible, politicians lie more to them. Much of that gullibility seems to me to be by choice; people seem to see themselves as good people if they give their leaders the benefit of the doubt.  Then they express righteous indignation if they discover that their leaders lied. But really, they are themselves mostly to blame.","180":" The Coming Cosmic Control Conflict  We moderns like to join factions associated with ideologies, and many of our most inspiring stories are of great conflicts between ideologically-affiliated factions. We like such stories more when they have more morally-intense ideologies, bigger conflicts in space, time, and social scope, more impressive combatants, and more real and well-defined events.At a cost in realism, science fiction and fantasy often turn up the other dials, making ideologies extreme, conflicts galaxy-wide, and giving combatants god-like powers. But for realism and definition, we tend to retreat to WWII, which ranks high on moral intensity, but less high on other criteria. Or more recent struggles for group respect. Our true stories of the largest scope, about our vast universe, tend to fail badly; past stories lack conflict or combatants, while future stories lack definition.Having recently given a lot of thought to grabby aliens and UFOs as aliens, it occurs to me that they can offer great conflict stories of substantial moral intensity, plausible realism and definition, and quite unprecedented size, scope, and combatant impressiveness. Let us consider telling such stories!The combatants in which we can be most confident are grabby aliens; the fact that we have appeared so early in the universe tells us that they are out there, and three other datums tell us we\u2019ll meet them in roughly a billion years, if we last that long. Grabby civilizations will come into direct conflict with each other at their borders, and will compete more widely to influence the culture of the next hundred billion years. These conflicts rate high on reality, scope, and impressive combatants, but alas it seems hard to guess how such civilizations will differ, and thus to guess the ideologies that might orient their conflicts.We can have less confidence that aliens are behind some UFOs. But they plausibly exist, and we can say a lot about a big ideological conflict they must have with grabby aliens. We can reasonably guess that UFO aliens have developed many millions of years past our level, are not changing fast now, and have coordinated to prevent any part of them from getting grabby, i.e., from aggressively expanding and filling the universe with their descendants. To achieve this, we can be pretty sure that they created a strong persistent \u201cworld\u201d governments. And enforcing their anti-grabby rules on us is the obvious reason for them to be here now coyly showing themselves to us.Furthermore, even if there are no aliens behind UFOs, we can forsee this same conflict in our future; we are likely to coordinate to try to prevent parts of our civilization from getting grabby. Thus the pro- vs. anti- grabby conflict is plausibly the big future ideological divide, whether or not UFOs are aliens. Let me explain.For at least a million years, human foragers coordinated within each band to enforce local norms; individual humans were not free to do whatever they wanted. With farming, societies became larger and had more contact with outsiders, but within each society they enforced many norms and laws. And in our world today we actually have pretty strong global coordination enforcing many global norms via local laws. Human organizations have consistently been rising in size and scope, making much stronger global governance a likely outcome over the coming centuries. (It certainly happens in Age of Em.)As an economist, I see that most people feel strongly that individual freedoms must be constrained by governance, and many seem to regret that we do not have stronger and larger scale governance to deal with our biggest problems. Few favor cutting our scales of governance. Even when governments seem to consistently fail at a task they\u2019ve been assigned, like the unwinnable war on drugs, most are reluctant to give up; instead budgets and powers are continually increased.Furthermore, I see these laments especially among futurists, who consider longer timescales and bigger problems. For example, many are uncomfortable with \u201ccapitalist\u201d competition, which they hope will end soon or at least become globally managed, to prevent capitalist competition between nations. And many are wary of plain old biological competition, even without capitalism. For example, many see a big problem with overpopulation, for which their natural solution is global regulation of fertility. Some imagine that local unconstrained evolution might eliminate consciousness from future agents, or allow the values of our descendants to drift far from our own values, and suggest strong global governance as remedies for these.In addition, we should expect rates of change due to natural selection to greatly increase with the rise of artificial life, which is likely to dominate our future starting in a few centuries. So whatever problems result from unmanaged natural selection are likely to become much stronger soon, and at a time when we in fact have a pretty strong world government.If within a few centuries we have a strong world government managing capitalist competition, overpopulation, value drift, and much more, we might come to notice that these and many other governance solutions to pressing problems are threatened by unrestrained interstellar colonization. Independent colonies able to change such solutions locally could allow population explosions and value drift, as well as capitalist competition that beats out home industries. That is, colony independence suggests unmanaged colony competition. In addition, independent colonies would lower the status of those who control the central government.So authorities would want to either ban such colonization, or to find ways to keep colonies under tight central control. Yet it seems very hard to keep a tight lid on colonies. The huge distances involved make it hard to require central approval for distant decisions, and distant colonists can\u2019t participate as equals in governance without slowing down the whole process dramatically. Worse, allowing just one sustained failure, of some descendants who get grabby, can negate all the other successes. This single failure problem gets worse the more colonies there are, the further apart they spread, and the more advanced technology gets.Thus if our descendants strongly value the regulations and coordinations that their world government allows, and are unwilling to give them up, then they may be strongly tempted to simply ban interstellar colonization beyond some manageable limits. Which is exactly what it seems that any aliens behind UFOs must have done successfully for millions of years. The exact opposite of the aggressive expansion that, for billions of years, has been and will continue to be chosen by grabby aliens.Yes, banning internal expansion should put any civilization at a great disadvantage should they ever encounter a grabby one. But that distant possibility in perhaps a billion years may just not carry much weight against more immediate concerns. It might be easier to slip into denial, emphasizing the lack of solid proof that there will ever be any grabby aliens.And there we have it: the grand cosmic conflict between authorities who use a strong world government to prevent local expansion, and grabby-wannabe rebels seeking a way to slip through this blockage and expand. A conflict with big values at stake, very impressive combatants, that takes places on the greatest scales of space, time, and social range, and which seems likely to be very real. Don\u2019t you want to hear stories about that? Won\u2019t someone write stories about that?","181":" Missing Life-Lessons  We learn many things over the space of our lives. With language, we can share such things with many others distant in space and time. With such a fantastic capacity, you might think we humans would hardly ever have to learn anything important directly for ourselves. But while we do learn many things from textbooks and mentors, we are surprisingly bad at teaching the most important life lessons. Like, for example, what its like to be married a long time, how to stay married, and when that is worth the trouble.One contributing factor is that folks, late in life, almost never write essays, or books, on \u201cwhat I\u2019ve learned about life.\u201d It would only take a few pages, and would seem to offer great value to others early in their lives. Why the silence? Some possible explanations:People don\u2019t actually learn much that can be abstracted from their life details.People don\u2019t want to hear the truth, and they won\u2019t find lies useful, so why bother.Young folks already think they know all the answers, so won\u2019t listen.It seems arrogant to offer lessons from your life when few others do this.When folks write on their life, they care much more to brag about what they did.Useful lessons will suggest the author had average success, which is shameful.The lessons of folks with way above average success aren\u2019t useful to average folks.People are too weak to write when they feel old enough to tell lessons.Few care what people will think of them after they are dead.Most lessons have been written, but few can be bothered to read them.None of these explanations seem especially satisfactory.

His dinner was gruel, which he prepared himself. Scrooge paid no man to wait on him. Scrooge has been called ungenerous. I say that\u2019s a bum rap. \u2026In this whole world, there is nobody more generous than the miser \u2014 the man who could deplete the world\u2019s resources but chooses not to. The only difference between miserliness and philanthropy is that the philanthropist serves a favored few while the miser *spreads his largess far and wide. \u2026Put a dollar in the bank and you\u2019ll bid down the interest rate by just enough so someone somewhere can afford an extra dollar\u2019s worth of vacation or home improvement. Put a dollar in your mattress and you\u2019ll drive down prices by just enough so someone somewhere can have an extra dollar\u2019s worth of coffee with his dinner. (more; HT Adrian Kent)Why are misers so widely criticized, if their gift is distributed unusually equitably, with little chance to receive praise or gratitude in return? Some might suggest this is caused by economic ignorance, but it seems far more likely that misers are criticized exactly because their gifts are equitable.Humans have had literally millions of years experience begging from one other. Many primates do it, as do foragers. A supplicant appeals to common feelings that one should help associates in need when one is doing well, in the expectation of getting help later when you are in need, and also of sending good signals about your loyalty and ability.Associates who hint that you should be less miserly and make more overt gifts are not at all hoping that you will spread your gift equitably across the world. They are instead hoping that you will unequally focus most of your gift on them. By criticizing a miserly associate, you are working to take the gift away from those distant recipients. Ask yourself: are you really more deserving than they? Do you care?Added 1:30p: Karl Smith says:The miser is not as generous as the dedicated philanthropist. \u2026 [He] is withholding his assessment of the most utility maximizing uses of his money. (HT TGGP)True, but I\u2019d still guess that the miser does more good than the average rich-nation philanthropist.","183":" Reply To Karl Smith  On Friday I wrote:[Imagine] a fountain of youth pill \u2026 [that had] to be \u2026 given to everyone over thirty \u2026 [and] required dosage doubled every decade [of age]. \u2026 Eventually we\u2019d run out of money to pay for these pills; we\u2019d have to say no to some people, and then they\u2019d quickly die. And the longer we waited before admitting to ourselves that we couldn\u2019t afford to give effective treatments to everyone, no matter what the cost, the worse it would be.Karl Smith replied:Why would it be worse the longer we lived in self-deception? That really needs to be spelled out because off the top it sounds like Robin is describing a scenario in which we maximize the the total amount of human life we can support. We are also doing this without implicitly valuing anyone\u2019s life over anyone else\u2019s. We save everyone we can, as long as we can, until we hit capacity. This could easily be a utopian scenario.Again, its probably not the scenario I prefer but one has to be explicit about exactly why throwing everything we have at an extremely effective method of preserving enormous amounts of human life is bad idea. It seems like something the average person would regard as a great idea.Well first we might not smoothly transition to a maximal sustainable state, but instead borrow too much, fail to maintain infrastructure, etc. Second, the steady state might have a pretty low quality of life, from spending everything possible on pills. Third, we could support much more human life by having new young kids who wouldn\u2019t need any pills for another thirty years. If the choice is between a million folks kept to age 200 or a billion folks keep to age 100, I\u2019ll take the billion any day.","184":" Fuller on Age of Em  I\u2019d heard that an academic review of Age of Em was forthcoming from the new Journal of Posthuman Studies. And after hearing about Baum\u2019s review, the author Steve Fuller of this second academic review (which won\u2019t be published for a few months) gave me permission to quote from it here. First some praise:I now credit him with having awakened in me the role that markets play in revealing a form of intelligence that humans tend to suppress as a result of norms of social cohesion that discourage accurate self-representation. The same Robin Hanson is the economist who has so far made the most substantive contributions to the contemporary definition of transhumanism, which he began (unbeknownst to me) at that time. The book under review is the culmination of a quarter-century journey that took flight with the publication of \u2018If uploads come first\u2019 .. Hanson went on to explore the political-economic consequences of this development through a lens informed mainly by Darwinian evolution and the economics of efficiency. The book expands these consequences into a full-blown anthropology of the future.I\u2019m not sure I deserve the \u201cmost substantive contributions\u201d label, but I appreciate the thought. Commenting on a 2007 discussion between James Hughes and I, Fuller says:Hughes sees the thought experiment as simply an exaggerated extension of current capitalist conditions, whereas Hanson treats it as a trigger for a fundamental rethinking of the ontological conditions of capitalism. Thus, Hughes worries that Hanson fails to provide a wealth redistribution scheme to prevent the further immiseration of poor people, while Hanson is open on how any such redistribution scheme might work, possibly including \u2018ems\u2019 among the entities in his welfare function. ..Hanson confounds this entire line of thought by effectively erasing the distinction between \u2018labour\u2019 and \u2018technology\u2019 as factors of production. .. The central normative issue surrounding \u2018The Age of Em\u2019 is one of accommodating the differing environmental requirements of humans and uploads so that they can cohabit not only peacefully but also equitably.The above seem fair descriptions to me.My basic fear is that we are heading into a world in which most of society\u2019s wealth is generated by computer-based providers like Google and Amazon who exploit our freely given data for their own purposes without adequate return to us \u2018donors\u2019 (Fuller 2016). In contrast, Hanson\u2019s thought experiment presumes that the arrival of brain upload technology will force a deep recalibration of values, including the value of Homo sapiens as such.I expect these to continue: a high capital share of total income, and high inequality in capital ownership. I consider possible value changes, but don\u2019t assume them. Most of the value changes I consider are due to changing per-capita income within the em and human groups.It is then reasonable to ask about the attitude that these digitally uploaded and enhanced versions of human minds are likely to have towards their intellectually and economically inferior progenitors. Hanson\u2019s own vision is relatively benign, based on the common evolutionary ancestry, so to speak, between ems and humans. Thus, ems do not seem to lose their original humanity, notwithstanding the practical difficulties in accommodating to the different material needs and spatiotemporal horizons of humans vis-\u00e0-vis ems. However, if we consider humanity\u2019s treatment of animals \u2014 including its nearest primate cousins \u2013 as a precedent, the prospects do not look quite so straightforward. In particular, the development of language \u2013 be it through divine creation or evolutionary history \u2013 has allowed Homo sapiens to self-alienate from the rest of nature. .. Once ems have become sufficiently different from humans by virtue of their own internal developments, they may become quite negligent in their treatment of humans, partly because they find it difficult to relate to human needs .. Em life-world may render us just as opaque to them as other primate species are to us.I\u2019m struck by how only half of those who imagine entering a Star Trek style transporter see the person exiting as themselves, but basically all of those who imagine exiting see the person entering as themselves. When we see ourselves on a (perhaps branching) timeline, we identify less with points further away from us, but for the same distance we identify much more with our ancestors than our descendants. So at any one time the larger chance is that biohumans won\u2019t see ems as basically the same. Which may be an issue during the early transition, when biohuman opinions matter more. The main thing that biohumans should worry about is that the age of em may only last a year or two, and we don\u2019t know what even faster changing regime may happen next. With enough change, yes, ems could eventually see biohumans more like how we animals, even if both can speak the same language.Hanson .. imagines that the benevolent nature of ems would lead them to dispose with humans in a manner akin to the sanctuaries currently provided to protected species. .. The ems do not seem likely to empower people beyond the point of allowing them to pursue a relatively pain-free existence in something resembling their natural habitats. In particular, it is not at all clear whether the cybercene would allow humans to engage in the feats of self-transcendence that in the modern period had enabled them to evacuate their habitats and even bodies, the very basis on which ems would have emerged in the first place. Here Hanson might consider .. a \u2018zoopolis\u2019 .. whereby other species are formally incorporated into the legal regimes governing the political and economic conditions of the human life-world.I imagined a basically peaceful relation such as retirees now have with non-retirees, where both do in fact share the same financial, legal, and political institutions. Biohumans aren\u2019t forbidden to do anything, but limited economic resources encourages them to move away from em concentrations.Two features of zoopolitanism .. potentially undermine the intuitive plausibility of Hanson\u2019s thought experiment. First, the introduction of uplift as a significant political technology amounts to creating a spectrum of cyborg creatures, which takes the sting out of the neatly disturbing \u2018us vs. them\u2019 premise that frames The Age of Ems.I\u2019ve explained why I don\u2019t hold much hope for \u201cthird way\u201d bio-electronic combinations to be competitive with ems. Bio-based hardware just has too many disadvantages.Second .. the energy requirements for computers to perform the multiple intelligent functions currently serviced by the human brain have continued to be prohibitive as a practical long-term prospect, even if achievable as a scientific goal. In short, Hanson\u2019s cybercene threatens to consume more of the Earth\u2019s energy than the Anthropocene that would have preceded it.I discuss energy requirements in the book, and estimate ems using much less energy than does a human brain, for the same mind speed. While energy limits might eventually limit an em economy, I doubt that happens during the one to two year age of em.","185":" RIP Medical Hypotheses  Medical Hypotheses was established with the express intent of allowing ideas outside the mainstream to be aired so that they could be debated openly.My article on medicine as a way to show we care was published in this (not especially prestigious) academic journal.

(The author of that previous study responded, suggesting official statistics are unreliable, and citing other sources that agreed with him.)  Duesberg\u2019s inexcusible crime was suggesting at the end of his article that available data might be better explained if HIV is not the main cause of AIDS:\u201cIs academic freedom such a precious concept that scientists can hide behind it while betraying the public so blatantly?\u201d asked John Moore, an Aids scientist at Cornell University, on a South African health news website last year.

Noah Smith complains about people like me:There\u2019s a fad in the economics world that annoys me. The fad is to describe every human action as \u201csignaling.\u201d This has to stop, people. \u2026 It\u2019s become fashionable in the economics world to label any and every human social interaction as a form of signaling. The most enthusiastic promoter of this way of thinking is GMU economist Robin Hanson. Fashion isn\u2019t self-expression \u2014 it\u2019s signaling. Leisure isn\u2019t about fun \u2014 it\u2019s about signaling. And so on.The problem is, this notion of \u201csignaling\u201d isn\u2019t really what Spence had in mind. Spence\u2019s signaling model was about proving yourself by doing something difficult \u2014 something so difficult that someone who didn\u2019t have what it takes wouldn\u2019t even bother. But most of what Hanson is talking about is just communication, not Spence-style signaling. Even if hipsters wax their moustaches in order to prove their hip-ness, that doesn\u2019t mean there are a whole bunch of wannabe hipsters out there who just didn\u2019t have what it takes to wax their moustaches. Communication, like signaling, is costly. But it\u2019s not a matter of jumping through hoops to prove yourself. (more; followup)Let\u2019s distinguish three different kinds of messages I might send with my waxed moustache:1) \u201cI have thick shiney hair.\u201d This message is verifiable. Soon enough, others can just directly check if it is true. So I don\u2019t need to pay costs to send this message, though I may pay costs to create the nice hair.2) \u201cHipster is one of my interest areas.\u201d If you and I are going to talk anyway, but must pick a conversation topic, we may share a sufficient common interest in finding talk topics of mutual interest. In such a context, it can be enough for me to just tell you about my interests. You can just accept my claims for the purpose of picking a talk topic. Technically, this is a \u201ccheap talk\u201d message.3) \u201cI am especially devoted to the hipster ethos\u201d or \u201cI especially embody hipster ideals.\u201d That is, I am especially willing to identify myself as a hipster, and my personal features are an especially high quality match to ideal hipster features, including having a creative and contrarian yet attractive and coherent personal style that fits with current hipster fashions. These messages are hard to verify, and the interests of observers and I conflict. While observers want to accurately rank me relative to others, I may want them to estimate me as having maximal devotion and quality. Since verification and cheap talk won\u2019t work here, I have to show, not just say, my messages.To show my hipster devotion, I can choose an appearance that is sufficiently off-putting to ordinary people at work, home, church, etc.. By paying the cost of putting off possible associates, I show my devotion to hipsterism. To show my hipster features, I can pay to track hipster fashions and to continually search in the space of possible styles for a combination that simultaneously reflects current fashions while being creative, coherent, and showing off my best personal features. Not being a hipster, I don\u2019t know how exactly that works for them. But I do know, for example, that since lipstick and tight clothes make some bodies look better while making other bodies look worse, they are costly signals of the quality of lips and body shape. There must be similar factors for showing off hipster qualities.More generally I call a message \u201csignaling\u201d if it has these features:It is not sent mainly via the literal meanings of words said.It is not easily or soon verifiable.It is mainly about the senders\u2019 personal features, perhaps via association with groups.It is about sender \u201cquality\u201d dimensions where more is better, so senders want others to believe quality is as high as possible, while others want to assess more accurately. Such qualities are not just unitary, but can include degrees of loyalty to particular allies.Cheap talk cannot send a message like this; one cannot just say such a thing, one must show it. And since it cannot be verified, one must show it indirectly, via how such features make one more willing or able to do something. And since willingness and ability track costs, these are \u201ccostly\u201d signals.When weighted by how much the messages matter to us, and by how much effort we put into adjusting them, I\u2019d say that most of our communication is \u201csignaling\u201d of this sort. Most of the private value, if not most of the bits.","187":" On Accidental Altruists  Gordon Tullock:All of us like to think that we are better, more altruistic, more charitable, than we actually are. But, although we have this desire, we don\u2019t want to pay for it. We are willing to make a sacrifice of perhaps 5 percent of our real income in charitable aid to others. We would like to think of ourselves, however, as making much larger transfers without actually making them. One of the functions of the politician in our society is to meet this demand. (more)Me:As an adolescent I seem to have deeply internalized the idea of great scientists\/visionaries as heroes. I long judged my efforts by their standards \u2013 what would increase the chance that I would become such a person, or be approved by one. Marching to the beat of this unusual status audience drummer often led me to \u201cnon-conform\u201d by doing things that less impressed folks around me. But I very definitely wanted to impress someone. (more)Let me admit it here and now: I am an accidental altruist, driven more by ambition than empathy. I have sought glory by understanding deep mysteries of quantum physics, disagreement, and human hypocrisy, by foreseeing the next great era after ours, and by inventing and deploying new forms of info aggregation in governance.I happen to believe that such actions will in fact give an unusually large expected benefit to the world. This is because I believe that in our era a great many things go quite wrong because we do not understand ourselves and our future, and because we aggregate info badly. But, I must admit that I might still pursue similar glories even if they gave little benefit. And perhaps even if they created modest harm.Now it is not a complete accident that our society offers glory to those who improve our governance or deepen our understanding of the world and ourselves. Or that more glory often goes to those whose contributions seem more likely to benefit us all. This is a somewhat functional way for a society to coordinate to improve itself. But the credit here should probably go to the slow process of cultural selection, whereby cultures with more functional institutions win out in competition with other cultures.I suspect that many will think less of me if they see my altruism as more accidental, relative to intentional. And this makes sense to the extent that people use altruism as a signal of niceness. That is, if you use how nice someone is toward the world as a whole as signal of how nice they would treat you as a friend, spouse, colleague, etc., then it makes sense to put less weight on accidental niceness. We accidental altruists probably tend to be less nice.But if what you wanted was just to encourage more altruism toward the world, I\u2019d think you\u2019d mostly just want to celebrate people more who actually do more good for the world, without caring that much if they are driven more by glory or empathy. Sure, when faced with an option where they might gain glory by hurting the world, such a person might well choose it. But in areas where pursuing glory tends mostly to help the world, my guess is that the world is helped more if we just praise all good done for the world, intend of focusing our praise mainly on those who do good for the purest of reasons. And I think we all pretty much know this.So why don\u2019t we just celebrate all good done, regardless of motive? I\u2019d guess it is because most of us care less about how to help the world overall, and more about how to use the altruism of others as a signal of their personal inclinations and abilities.","188":" History of Transition Inequality  I\u2019ve posted recently on how the max innovations are meta ones bringing faster innovation rates.  I also posted recently on how faster growth rates reduce the natural genocide effect whereby success fluctuations make most lineages eventually extinct.  Today, let\u2019s consider what we know about the extra inequality that has arisen because some lineages embodied new growth modes before others.For example, the transition to multi-cellular organisms produced huge inequality.  A probably tiny initial lineage soon came to dominate the metabolism, if not the mass, of life on Earth.  Then for the next half billion years animal brain sizes doubled roughly every thirty million years, but species only lasted about one to twenty million years.It is not clear how large was the first lineage or species to embody the key human brain innovation (whatever that was), but apparently our ancestors have since suffered a few bottlenecks where at most a few thousand individuals then essentially gave rise to all descendants now.  When successive waves of explorers left Africa, it seems later waves almost completely displaced earlier waves.  And groups of about seventy people apparently colonized both Polynesia and the New World.The lineages that first mastered farming did gain from it, but their advantage was not as overwhelming as before.  In Europe, Africa, and Bali it seems post-transition population was about 20-50% from invading farmer groups, and the rest from the previous locals.  Locals learned to adapt invader techniques fast enough to survive.For the industrial revolution, the advantage seems even smaller.  In 1500, Western Europe seems to have had about 18% of world population, and today it has about 4%.  It seems unlikely that more than half of people today are descended from year 1500 Western Europeans.  So they seem to have gained less than a relative factor of 2.5 in number of descendants by starting the industrial revolution.  In GDP terms they have gained more of course.Overall it seems that singularity first-movers have gained smaller advantages in successive singularities.  Dare we hope this pattern will continue?  Tomorrow I\u2019ll try to make some sense of this pattern (though you are of course welcome to discuss it today).","189":" CO2 Warming Looks Real  Many have bent my ear over the last few months about global warming skepticism.   So I\u2019ve just done some moderate digging, and conclude:In the last half billion years, CO2 has at times been 15 times denser, but not more than 10C warmer.  So that is about as bad as warming could get.In the last million years, CO2 usually rises after warming; clearly warming often causes CO2 increases.CO2 is clearly way up (~30%) over 150 years, and rising fast, mainly due to human emissions.  CO2 is denser than its been for a half million years.The direct warming effect of CO2 on warming is mild and saturating; the effects of concern are indirect, e.g., water vapor and clouds, but the magnitude and sign of these indirect effects are far from clear.Climate model builders make indirect effect assumptions, but most observers are skeptical they\u2019ve got them right.This uncertainty alone justifies substantial CO2 mitigation (emission cuts or geoengineering), if we are risk-averse enough and if mitigation risks are weaker.Standard warming records show a real and accelerating rise, roughly matching the CO2 rise.Such warming episodes seem common in recent history.The match between recent warming and CO2 rise details is surprisingly close, substantially raising confidence that CO2 is the main cause of recent warming.  (See this great analysis by Pablo Verdes.)  This adds support for mitigation.Among the few bets on global warming, the consensus is for more warming.Geoengineering looks far more likely to be feasible and acceptable mitigation than emissions cuts.Some doubt standard warming records, saying they are biased by urban measuring sites and arbitrary satellite record corrections.   Temperature proxies like tree rings diverge from standard records in the last fifty years. I don\u2019t have time to dig into these disputes, so for now I defer to the usual authorities.It was mostly skeptics bending my ear, and skeptical arguments are easier to find on the web.  But for now, the other side has convinced me.Added: The Verdes papers is also here.  Here is his key figure:The reconstructed forcing is made without any reference to the actual forcing, and with almost no free parameters, and yet matches it very well!Added 1June: Verdes tells me he\u2019s now in industry and hasn\u2019t done any followup work, nor knows of any.  The data and method are public; seems a great topic for some grad student.","190":" Too Much Hope  Did you have great hopes for Xmas?  Were you disappointed, but think it was good at least for you to have hoped?  Turns out, hope need not make you happier.  From the NYT Year in Ideas :Prisoners with life sentences but with the possibility of parole adapt less well to prison life, for example, than prisoners with life sentences without the possibility of parole. \u2026 The research team \u2026 tracked people who had portions of their colons removed or bypassed, such that the patients couldn\u2019t defecate normally. The condition is extremely unpleasant and leads many people to say they\u2019d rather be dead. \u2026 But a colostomy isn\u2019t always permanent. Some patients are likely to heal and have their bowels reconnected. .  Were it up to the patient to choose, \"almost anybody would choose temporary over permanent,\" Ubel says.So it\u2019s surprising that the permanent-colostomy patients ended up happier six months after the operation than the temporary group, whose members were still holding out hope. \u2026 It might seem strange that patients who are better off objectively were less satisfied with their lives, yet the finding makes sense: \"If your condition is temporary,\" Ubel explains, \"you\u2019re thinking, I can\u2019t wait until I get rid of this.\" Ubel says thoughts like these keep you from moving on with your life and focusing on the many good things that remain. \u2026Gregory Miller \u2026 found that teenage girls who are unable to disengage themselves from trying to attain hard-to-reach goals exhibited increased levels of the inflammatory molecule C-reactive protein (C.R.P.), which in adults is linked with diabetes, heart disease and early aging. \u2026  At the outset of their experiment, Miller and Wrosch asked each teenage subject what would count for her as adversity and what would count as success. Then the researchers tracked how the young women dealt with their own setbacks and adversity over the course of a year. \u2026 \"We found that the girls who were best able to disengage when a goal became difficult or unattainable are those who have constant levels of C.R.P.,\" Miller says. Teenagers who persisted \u2013 even if they eventually attained their goals \u2013 had significantly elevated levels.This reminds me of Tyler Cowen on chess:Chess is characteristic for its lack of self-deception; it is hard to avoid knowing where you stand in the hierarchy and excuses are few and far between.  That\u2019s why most chess players are depressed.Tyler says people can be happier in a caste society, where the lack of mobility means no one can blame your position on your lack of effort.","191":" UFOs as US PsychOp  UFOs are objects in the sky that often seem to display amazing physical abilities. We have four main categories of theories to explain them. Under two kinds of theories, these abilities are illusory: (A) They could be errors, delusions, and misunderstandings, like seeing Venus or swamp gas. Or (B), they could be lies and hoaxes, intended to fool others. Under the other two kinds of theories, these abilities are real: (C) They are from aliens. Or (D) they are from Earth orgs that have been hiding their amazing abilities.To estimate the chance of each kind of theory, one should multiply a prior chance for each type, a chance which ignores any concrete evidence of actual sightings, times a posterior chance that if each theory were true, we\u2019d see the sort of sightings evidence that we do. (Renormalize these products to get posteriors.) A year ago I argued that the prior chance on the aliens theory wasn\u2019t nearly as low as many seem to think; its much higher than in a typical murder trial, for example. So you have to actually look at the sightings evidence to judge its posterior chance, just as you would in a murder trial.Today I want to consider the hoax category. In particular I want to consider the following hoax conspiracy theory: some part of the US government has, since the 1940s, had a long-term campaign to pay people to lie about seeing UFOs, and to make fake evidence to fool others into thinking they saw objects with amazing abilities. Of course once enough people heard about these events, then most reported sightings after that might be errors, delusions, and misunderstandings.During the Second World War, the US government managed some pretty large and effective conspiracies. Such as the Manhattan project and the many ways they mislead Germany about our D-Day invasion. They seem thus to have then been roughly capable of managing a large UFO conspiracy. But, yes, the duration of this purported conspiracy would be much longer than in these prior examples.Those prior successful conspiracies were also more closely related to military activities. Do we have evidence of a US ability or inclination regarding conspiracies more distant from military operations? Yes, in fact. The US had large and successful efforts, kept hidden for many decades, to move the fashion in art and writing away from Soviet styles, toward \u201cmodern\u201d US styles. To make the US seem more prestigious relative to the USSR in the world\u2019s eyes.Okay, but what might the US government see itself as standing to gain from such a conspiracy? First, it is already known that the US government has promoted UFO groups in particular areas, and fed them false info on UFOs. They did this to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d regarding new tech that the US was developing and testing in the skies. Spies of foreign powers might plausibly hang near US testing facilities, and ask around around for reports of strange sightings. Such spies would get less useful info if local UFO groups are inclined to report many strange things unrelated to US tech testing.In the Cold War, a big priority of the US military was to discourage enemies from launching a nuclear war against the US. And as an enemy is more likely to attack when then feel more confident of the consequences of their attack, one way to discourage such attacks is to muddy the waters re US military abilities, and re other possible powers who might react to such an attack. So if US could get enemy leaders to take UFO reports seriously, it could get those leaders to worry that they have underestimated US abilities, or that there are another hidden powers around.Many UFO reports and interpretations have given the impression that the powers behind UFOs are especially interested in nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and that they fear or disapprove of such things. Enemy leaders who give credence to such reports might then fear that, if they initiated a nuclear attack, they\u2019d suffer retaliation from such powers. Or maybe they\u2019d just step in to take control after such a war weakened all of its participants.I estimate roughly a one percent prior for this scenario, which is substantially higher than the prior I assigned to UFOs as aliens. Furthermore, this theory seems to quite naturally account for the key puzzles I struggled to explain regarding an aliens theory, namely that they are here while the universe looks empty, and that they stay near the limits of our vision, neither making themselves clearly visible nor completely invisible. This hoax category thus has the strongest posterior, in my view. (Yes I haven\u2019t discussed the other two theory categories much; maybe I\u2019ll say more on those some other day.)Note that conditional on this UFO as US psychop theory being true, we should give more credence to other US conspiracy theories, such as that the US faked the moon landings. I thus now give more credence to this, even if I still see it as less likely than not. And conditional on believing other such theories, this UFO as US psychop theory becomes more believable.Added 10a: As the two US WWII secrets I mentioned were kept for only a few years, some say large orgs can\u2019t keep secrets longer than that. But the US kept secret for 41 years that it faked its excuse for the Vietnam war, and for 46 years that it spied on citizen phone calls via Project Minaret. KFC has kept its recipe secret for 70 years, and Coca-Cola has kept its secret for 130 years. Venice kept its glass-blowing methods secret for many centuries, and China kept secret its methods of making both silk and porcelain for over a thousand years.Yes, there\u2019s a difference between hidden and known secrets, but all else equal known secrets should be more vulnerable, as the curious can focus their efforts on revealing them. Much harder to focus efforts when searching for hidden secrets.","192":" War Games Are Fake  Millennium Challenge 2002 (MC02) was a major war game exercise conducted by the United States armed forces in mid-2002, likely the largest such exercise in history. The exercise \u2026 cost $250 million, involved both live exercises and computer simulations. MC02 was meant to be a test of future military \u201ctransformation\u201d\u2014a transition toward new technologies that enable network-centric warfare and provide more powerful weaponry and tactics.Red, commanded by retired Marine Corps Lt. General Paul K. Van Riper, used old methods to evade Blue\u2019s sophisticated electronic surveillance network. Van Riper used motorcycle messengers to transmit orders to front-line troops and World War II light signals to launch airplanes without radio communications. \u2026 In a preemptive strike, Red launched a massive salvo of cruise missiles that overwhelmed the Blue forces\u2019 electronic sensors and destroyed sixteen warships. This included one aircraft carrier, ten cruisers and five of six amphibious ships. An equivalent success in a real conflict would have resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 service personnel. \u2026 Another significant portion of Blue\u2019s navy was \u201csunk\u201d by an armada of small Red boats, which carried out both conventional and suicide attacks that capitalized on Blue\u2019s inability to detect them as well as expected.At this point, the exercise was suspended, Blue\u2019s ships were \u201cre-floated\u201d, and the rules of engagement were changed. \u2026 The war game was forced to follow a script drafted to ensure a Blue Force victory. \u2026 Red Force was ordered to turn on all his anti-aircraft radar in order for them to be destroyed, and Red Force was not allowed to shoot down any of the aircraft bringing Blue Force troops ashore. \u2026 They also ordered Red Force not to use certain weapons systems against Blue Force and even ordered that the location of Red Force units to be revealed. This led to accusations that the war game had turned from an honest, open free play test of America\u2019s war-fighting capabilities into a rigidly controlled and scripted exercise intended to end in an overwhelming American victory. \u2026Due to his criticism regarding the scripted nature of the new exercise, Van Riper resigned his position in the midst of the war game. \u2026 Navy Capt. John Carman, Joint Forces Command spokesman, said the war game had properly validated all the major concepts which were tested by Blue Force, ignoring the artificially imposed restrictions placed on Van Riper\u2019s Red Force which led them to succeed. (more)War colleges, where people learn to be soldiers, often have war simulations where different people play different parts of a war between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d Students and others are told that these are realistic, or at least as realistic as is feasible given the simplifications that simulations and games require.But I\u2019ve now heard personally from enough independent expert insider sources that I\u2019m willing to post it: the above example was not a rare exception; war games are mostly fake.They are designed so that our side wins, and so that the official strategy that we teach students actually prevails. Every once in a while some joker plays \u201cthem\u201d cleverly and wins, and then their career is over. The games also make sure terrifying outcomes never happen, even in a game where \u201cwe\u201d win. For example, it is forbidden to sink an aircraft carrier.I\u2019m told that that fake war games and simulations are common in the rest of the military too. Simulations that show realistic levels of outcome uncertainty and variance tend to be rejected in favor of low variance ones that suggest outcomes just can\u2019t get very bad.You might have thought that because in the military most everyone\u2019s freedom and lives are on the line, the military at least would try hard to create realistic estimates of the outcomes of their policies. But you\u2019d be wrong. Organizational disfunction plagues them as well. Apparently military leaders think it is more important to instill confidence in the troops and citizens than to actually find out how wars would go.Now ask yourself: since your freedom and lives aren\u2019t on the line in your organization, just how much more dysfunctional might be your outcome estimating processes?","193":" Why Track Trends?  I just read my first book via phone, Tyler\u2019s The Great Stagnation. Turned out to be a surprisingly pleasant way to read, especially while traveling.Tyler\u2019s thesis is that the US has slower growth than decades ago because we\u2019ve used up the low hanging fruits of easy industry-era innovations, mass education, and cutting discrimination. The mismatch between growth expectations and realities is behind our financial and deficit crises. As solutions he suggests we lower our expectations and raise the social status of scientists.My grad school (Caltech) didn\u2019t teach macro, and I never took undergrad econ, so I\u2019ve tried to avoid pontificating on macro topics. Tyler\u2019s growth slowdown story sounds plausible, but others disagree, so I\u2019ll stay agnostic for now.But what I can speak to is how little such trend analysis or projection matters, at least for most economic policy. The complexities of the world often make it hard to say with great confidence which policies will increase economic welfare. Even so, given our usual way of doing economic analysis, the  question of which institutions will most increase economic welfare rarely depends much on the exact values of the sorts of parameters social scientists and the media track with such enthusiasm and concern.Yes, knowing your budget can help you decide how much to spend, and so yes firms and governments should attend to clues about their future revenue. But in a good economic institution, it will be some folks\u2019 job to attend to such clues and signal their conclusions to others, so that important actions can depend on such things. We economists should mainly worry about arranging the incentives, etc. for that job, and then leave it to them to figure it out the details.Alas Tyler doesn\u2019t even discuss what are good institutions for this job of dealing with uncertainties in future growth rates. I\u2019d guess that huge political coalitions fighting to the death to maintain their expected government benefit increases is particularly bad at adapting to such uncertainties. With private pensions, medical plans, etc. adaptation would still be painful, but would less threaten our national stability.Tyler also gets it wrong by suggesting we raise the status of scientists. It is engineers and business innovators more generally, whose status needs a boost. Scientists already claim too much credit for social innovation \u2013 they have little to do with most of it. Tyler also doesn\u2019t mention over-regulation, a huge barrier to innovation. Consider this recent quote on flying cars:The company has cleared the biggest hurdle: building a safe flying, driving and converting vehicle. But there are other obstacles ahead. Foremost, the vehicle needs regulatory clearance from an alphabet soup of agencies, including the FAA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The company says it is working closely with regulators to ensure that the aircraft meets all standards. It has won important exemptions to certain road and air rules.But any \u201cno\u201d from any regulator \u2014 for being a pound overweight, or having a bumper an inch too short, or failing to have adequate airbags, or a thousand other issues \u2014 means at best delays and at worst a failed project. Weight, especially, has proven problematic for the company, Dietrich says \u2014 in part because a heavy car is a safe car, but a light plane is a safe plane, two engineering truths that are hard to square. (more)As Bryan wisely notes, people attend too much to recent news and trends, and too little to fundamental, at least for the purpose of gaining useful insights.","194":" I\u2019m A Sim, Or You Aren\u2019t  The simulation argument says that if our future descendants create enough (detailed) computer simulations of their ancestors, then you and I are likely to actually be such simulations living in a simulated world, instead of being the year 2011 humans we think we are. My simple variation on this argument concludes that either 1) ordinary people are pretty surely not simulations, or 2) very interesting people pretty surely are simulations. Add one plausible assumption, and both of these claims become true!Now for details. Here is a standard simulation argument:The [number] of all observers in the universe with human-type experiences that are living in [entire-history] computer simulations [is p*N*H.] \u2026 Here p is the fraction of all human-level technological civilizations that manage to reach a posthuman stage, N is the average number of times a posthuman civilization runs a simulation of its entire ancestral history, and H is the average number of individuals that have lived in a civilization before it reached a posthuman stage. (more)So if p*N > 1, then most human-type experiences are actually ancestor simulations, and hence your experience as a human is likely to actually be a simulation experience. Thus we might conclude:At least one of three propositions is true:[p << 1] The human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a posthuman stage[N << 1] The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running a significant number of ancestor simulations is extremely small.[p*N >> 1] We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation. (more)However, if we call M the average number of human ancestors simulated by each posthuman civilization, then I expect  M >> N*H. That is, I expect far more simulated humans in general than those specifically in \u201ca simulation of [the] entire ancestral history.\u201d Today, small-scale coarse simulations are far cheaper than large-scale detailed simulations, and so we run far more of the first type than the second. I expect the same to hold for posthuman simulations of humans \u2013 most simulation resources will be allocated to simulations far smaller than an entire human history, and so most simulated humans would be found in such smaller simulations.Furthermore I expect simulations to be quite unequal in who they simulate in great detail \u2013 pivotal \u201cinteresting\u201d folks will be simulated in full detail far more often than ordinary folks. In fact, I\u2019d guess they\u2019d be simulated over a million times more often. Thus from the point of view of a very interesting person, the chances that that person is in a simulation should be more than a million times the chances from the point of view of an ordinary person. From this we can conclude that either:Ordinary people can be be pretty sure that they are not in a simulation, orVery interesting people can be pretty sure that they are in a simulation.If, for the purpose of a blog post dramatic title, we presume (probably incorrectly) that I\u2019m a very interesting person, and that you the reader are an ordinary person, then the conclusion becomes: I\u2019m a sim, or you are not.Furthermore, both of these statements would apply if:p*M, the expected number of simulated humans per human civilization, is within a factor F (e.g., a thousand) of the number of actual humans H, and ifinteresting folks are simulated more than F2 as often as ordinary folks.So unless p*M is so different from H that everyone can be pretty sure they are a simulation, or pretty sure that they are not, ordinary people can be sure they are not while very interesting people can be sure they are.","195":" Do One-Eyed Rule Blind?  A 1904 H.G. Wells short story, \u201cCountry of the Blind\u201c, questioned the old proverb \u201cIn the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.\u201d In the story, a sighted man stumbles into a long isolated mountain valley where where everyone has been blind for generations, and have adapted their social customs and other senses to being blind.  This new man assumes he will soon be king, but to the locals he seems incompetent:They thrust him suddenly through a doorway into a room as black as pitch, save at the end there faintly glowed a fire. The crowd closed in behind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer of day, and before he could arrest himself he had fallen headlong over the feet of a seated man. His arm, outflung, struck the face of someone else as he went down.His attempts to prove he can see things they cannot go badly.  He underestimates what they can sense via sound:He would show these people once and for all what sight would do for a man. They would seek him, but not find him.\u201cYou move not, Bogota,\u201d said the voice.He laughed noiselessly and made two stealthy steps aside from the path.\u201cTrample not on the grass, Bogota; that is not allowed.\u201dNunez had scarcely heard the sound he made himself. He stopped, amazed.He also miss-specifies a test he offers to pass:He induced them to let him go a long way up the sloping meadows towards the wall with one complaisant individual, and to him he promised to describe all that happened among the houses. He noted certain goings and comings, but the things that really seemed to signify to these people happened inside of or behind the windowless houses\u2013the only things they took note of to test him by\u2013and of those he could see or tell nothing.The claim isn\u2019t that a person with a powerful new insight could never prove it to others. Rather, the point is that someone with a new insight could easily fail by arrogance, assuming his insight offers more than it does, and underestimating what can be done, and how things look, without it.The sighted person in this story could have succeeded by carefully mastering the usual skills and practices of the blind, and then carefully seeking simple clear ways to show how his new ability could give advantage, in the context of their usual practices.  Assuming instead that your new insight excuses you from the need to follow the usual social paths, or to learn the usual insights and skills of your chosen area, is a recipe for failure.","196":" Competition Cuts Spite  Psychologists are exploring spitefulness in its customary role as a negative trait, a lapse that should be embarrassing but is often sublimated as righteousness, as when you take your own sour time pulling out of a parking space because you notice another car is waiting for it and you\u2019ll show that vulture who\u2019s boss here, even though you\u2019re wasting your own time, too. \u2026The new research on spite transcends older notions that we are savage, selfish brutes at heart, as well as more recent suggestions that humans are inherently affiliative creatures yearning to love and connect. Instead, it concludes that vice and virtue, like the two sides of a V, may be inextricably linked. (More)Our simplest economic models assume selfish agents, and in those models market competition helps such agents, encouraging efficient allocation, adaptation, and innovation. A standard critique, however, says that real humans are more altruistic than this, which they say favors non-market institutions such as families and hierarchies which better channels this altruism.However, while it is true that humans are often more other-oriented than in our simplest econ models, this other-orientation is as likely to be spiteful as generous. For example:Given the opportunity 2\/3 of subjects will act spitefully, and 1\/3 of them maximally so.In \u201cpublic goods\u201d experiments, where participants voluntarily contribute to a public project, letting them punish each other does get them to contribute more, but they can be worse off as a result, due to the harms from all that punishment.Shame and indignation are common and powerful feelings, that often lead people take substantial risks (e.g. via violence) to hurt people around them.We seem eager for war stories, and to identify with heroes who sacrifice for their war, a war not just for private gain but to right big wrongs. Yet such characters (and their readers) usually think little on if their side is really the right side, or if war is really the best way right relevant wrongs.Strong racism and sexism seem to have been real things, where people paid substantial personal costs to dump on certain classes of people, in part to show loyalty to their side of some social divisions.What if many people often see themselves as in moral \u201cwars\u201d with many others around them, so that they are willing to pay substantial costs to help allies and to punish or put down enemies? And what if they coordinate with allies to try to control the \u201chigh grounds\u201d in such wars? Do such changes make market competition more or less attractive?The big obvious implication I see, relative to a world of relatively selfish people, is that in this world people would be more wary of associating with enemies, and more eager to associate with allies. So when people are free to choose associates, they would tend to choose allies, making fewer opportunities for spite and more for altruism. That is, competition would cut spite.However, when there exist non-competitive positions of power, moral warriors would be especially eager to gain control of those positions, to dump on their enemies. For example, if students have no choice of teachers, then becoming a teacher lets you dump on enemy students. And if residents have no control over police on nearby beats, then becoming a police lets you dump on nearby enemy residents. In contrast, when teachers and police must compete to attract and retain affiliations with students and residents, then they would expect to lose their competitions by mistreating enemies.Thus when many people see themselves in moral wars, eager to help allies and hurt enemies, potential targets of spite should be especially worried about being subject to such non-competitive positions of power. They should be especially eager to instead have many competing choices in key aspects of their lives, and be especially wary of creating centralized government regulators and service providers.Bottom line: while some say the existence of altruism is an argument for fewer competitive relations, the existence of spite is an argument for more choice and competition, and for  fewer centralized roles which less restrain spite, and which would be fought over by moral warriors seeking to hurt enemies.This may not be the strongest argument for market competition; that is probably still adaptation and innovation. But I haven\u2019t heard this argument before, and it seems especially easy for most people to understand.Added noon: To clarify, I assume that for most people, their preference to not have a teacher who hates them is stronger than their preference for their enemies to have teachers who hate them. I\u2019m assuming some substantial fraction of strongly spiteful (or altruistic) people, but I\u2019m not assuming that most people are like this.Added 9Sep: A recent article on spite.","197":" Fantasy\u2019s Essence  After complaining about bad economics in the Harry Potter world, Megan McArdle describes the essence of such fantasy:It is the meanest sort of Victoriana, the fantasy world of a child Herbert Spencer. There is a hereditary aristocracy of talent, and I am secretly at its apex. There is an elite school almost nobody can go to, and I am one of the chosen. People fall quite neatly into the categories of good, bad, or clueless, we are the good ones who get to run things in the end. That\u2019s powerful fantasy stuff, which is why it\u2019s so common.Being in a contrarian mood, I\u2019ve chosen this Harry Potter week to read Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials fantasy trilogy.  It is deeper than Potter\u2019s world, though uneven, has the same essence at its core, and its economics isn\u2019t that much better.  But I was charmed by this self-description:Philip Pullman believes firmly in the virtues of healthy exercise and a moderate diet \u2013 for other people. It makes them feel virtuous, and makes them feel good if not happy. The most exercise he normally takes is unscrewing the top of the whisky bottle.and his preferred writing process:essenceWell, then you take your big piece of paper with the plot on its yellow Post-It Notes, and your careful notes about the characters, and your photocopied information about castles and Finland, and you bundle it all up into a heap and you throw it all away.

And you start writing something completely different, something that you have no knowledge of, something that just came into your head, something that is utterly strange to you.And you\u2019re seized by a fever of excitement. It\u2019s like falling in love; it\u2019s like setting out on a thrilling voyage; it\u2019s like no other joy in the world. You are possessed. You feel radiant. You give off light.","198":" Time Reversal In Tenet  The mew movie Tenet shows plenty of eye-candy action and charismatic characters, though it didn\u2019t really make me care much emotionally about its characters or their problems. The movie did, however, scratch my big physics idea itch. So I\u2019m going to talk a bit about the movie\u2019s key physics premise. I\u2019ll give spoilers; you are warned.First the movie\u2019s key social premises seem quite crazy, even if they are common in action movies. The movie postulates that future scientists figured out how to locally reverse, or \u201cinvert\u201d, the flow of time, and so now often move and send stuff back through time that way. In addition, one of them also figured how to invert time across the entire world (or universe?), which would supposedly destroy all of us. To prevent that, this scientist broke her \u201calgorithm\u201d into nine physical parts and hid them back in her past, in our world. There\u2019s now a war between a future alliance seeking to find and activate these parts and other future alliance seeking to stop them.Our hero starts out as a CIA agent who takes what he thinks is a suicide pill, awakes, and is told he has passed a test of true devotion. He is then told about this time war and is invited to join the our-time army on the sly. But not as a U.S. representative with official approval; the U.S. isn\u2019t to be told about it. Our hero promptly joins, quickly hurting many people in the process, yet without doing much research to check out these crazy claims.I\u2019m pretty sure that the vast majority of CIA agents will not drop their U.S. allegiance on the sly to join some new army, just because some folks says some crazy sounding stuff, and do a few magic tricks. Which seems on average a good thing. I\u2019m also pretty sure there are far easier ways to destroy an algorithm, if the info about it remains sufficiently localized in spacetime. And I have strong doubts about the feasibility or wisdom of inverting all of time, even if local inversions are feasible. More on this below.Today most of our physical laws are about rather local processes, saying how stuff here and now must relate to stuff nearby in spacetime. But there\u2019s one big exception: the second law of thermodynamics, which in effect puts a constraint on the earliest state of the universe, saying it must have been a state of extremely low entropy. The rest of universe seems well predicted by the usual local processes plus this one early constraint. Together they imply an increasing entropy \u201cflow of time\u201d from this distant past state toward our future.As we don\u2019t know where this constraint comes from, it isn\u2019t completely crazy to imagine that it might be possible to make some new device which adds other similar constraints at other smaller places in spacetime. Strong constraints of low entropy at points in our future would induce \u201cinverted\u201d, or backwards, flows toward our time. And in principle, the \u201cinitial\u201d state of this backward flow might be set equal to that of some nearly forward moving flow, which is then ended. That is, some forward moving people and stuff might be suddenly turned and sent moving backward, or some backward moving stuff might be turned to move forward.So far, this matches the movie. But in the middle, where forward and backward moving time flows meet, the obvious thing to expect is a gradual blending, wherein the state is predicted as the most likely state given all the constraints in its full light cone. So when people moving forward and backward in time interact a lot with each other, they should blend together into a bloody gory deadly mess.However, what we see in the movie is that flows look far more binary and stable. For example, early in the movie the hero visits a museum full of inverted materials, including an inverted bullet. Within the bullet the flow is supposedly backwards, even though most stuff around it is moving forward, and even after many years of strong entropy interactions with other materials nearby. I find it hard to see this as the result of adding more low entropy constraints to more places in spacetime.But we don\u2019t understand this low entropy constraint very well. So maybe it really could be more of a setting of a binary flow direction within particular materials, a setting that follows the material around where ever it goes? This doesn\u2019t fit physics I understand, but okay. It would apparently allow the creation of perpetual motion machines, that generate arbitrary free energy to run any machines forever. Including big bombs. So all those inverted materials shown in that museum with that bullet would actually be incredible valuable to make perpetual motion machine parts.Even with this binary flow in a material assumption, the interaction between adjacent materials should still be set by thermodynamics, however. The state observed should still be what is most likely given the state constraints within each connected material. But I have a hard time fitting this with what we saw in that first museum, much less the rest of the movie.Our hero is shown waving his hand above an unspent bullet, which then flies up into his hand, and pulling the trigger on an empty gun, just before which a spent bullet flies out from being stuck in a wall and enters the gun to become an unspent bullet. Neither of these seem to me at all the most likely events given the local entropy constraints. It seems to me that the entropy calculations say that the more likely events are that the hand just waves with no bullet jumping up, and that the gun makes an empty trigger click with the spent bullet staying in the wall. These may be nice vivid examples of experiencing events in reverse, but they do not seem to me how these materials should behave, even with time inversion.The usual question in time travel movies is how grandfather paradoxes are resolved. This question is often evaded by assuming inconsistent outcomes happen in different parallel universes. But if you are going to face it head on, which this movie seems to want, the interesting thing to see is what exactly would prevent someone trying to create an inconsistency. I don\u2019t think I saw this issue directly engaged in Tenet, but I\u2019ve only seen the movie once; maybe I missed something.But one big consistency issue arise with the movie\u2019s extreme scenario of inverting the entire planet, or whatever, at a moment. Since we\u2019ve already seen history up to that moment, all this can mean is reversing the flow of time after that moment. But that only allows future people to exist for the duration from their future date back to that date at which the flow is reversed. And if everyone is reversed at once at some future date as well, then afterward from their point of view everything around them would look exactly the same; only the distant universe might have any different relation. So if you had problems before with resources or ecological damage, those problems continue exactly as before. And now you can only continue another few years before you hit that earlier date and end. So what\u2019s the point?","199":" The Protection Exception  We have many regulations, justified in many ways. One common type of regulation prevents people from making and enforcing certain voluntary agreements, and one common justification for such regulation is that we protect people from hurting themselves via such agreements. For example:Chief Justice Robert Bauman ruled in favour of the section of the [Canadian] Criminal Code outlawing polygamous unions. \u2026 Bauman said while the law does infringe on religious freedom, it is justified given the harm polygamy causes to children, women and society. (more)However, almost every such protection comes with one huge loophole, big enough to drive many a truck through: we let people emigrate to other countries. For example, we protect you and your kids from the harms of voluntary polygamy agreements, except that you and your kids may move to a nation that allows polygamy. The same applies to pretty much any other regulatory protection we offer, such as protections against buying unsafe products, hiring unlicensed professionals, paying for sex, or selling yourself into slavery. You are allowed to do any of these things as long as you first move to another nation that allows it.This raises an obvious question: why do we allow this huge hole in the \u201cprotections\u201d we maintain? It would seem to me more consistent to either:Prevent people from moving to nations that do not preserve the protections we think important, orLet locals make voluntary agreements that violate our basic protections, as long they plausibly demonstrate that they are so committed to such arrangements that they\u2019d consider leaving the nation to get them.Its seems pointless to consistently let people leave the nation to evade our \u201cprotections,\u201d since after they leave, they aren\u2019t protected. What gives?Added 11p: Some responses to comments:I am addressing paternalistic regulation rationales. Of course rules to limit local externalities are consistent with letting folks emigrate.Some say the only way to show a willingness to move is to move. But similar folks moving for similar reasons could be evidence that you\u2019d move, and we could invite folks who have moved to come back with fewer limits.Some say we shouldn\u2019t expect law to make any sense so its a mistake to try to explain legal patterns. That seems a head-in-sands approach to me.Some say it is hard to prevent people from leaving. But we don\u2019t even try. And we wouldn\u2019t have to prevent leaving to any nation, just to nations that are especially unprotective.Some say we let people leave because we realize our rules might be wrong. But that would equally justify stopping those rules at home.My best guess here: We don\u2019t limit emigration because the nations that have done so are now low status and we don\u2019t want to look like them. Limiting people at home does much less to lower our status, so we feel more free to do that. We mostly make such limits for other reasons, and pretend we want to protect people.Added 8a: This also can\u2019t just be that we don\u2019t care about people who are not longer part of \u201cus\u201d, since we let people temporarily travel to other nations to evade limits. People travel to Holland for weed, Thailand for prostitutes, and Spain for watching bulls killed.","200":" Sustainable Music  Recently I [saw] \u2026 a cake that bore the iced command, \u201cCelebrate Sustainability!\u201d Clearly the candle had been passed. For more than a generation, cakes at campus events have tutored students to \u201cCelebrate Diversity!\u201d Something has changed. \u2026 Diversity and sustainability have a complicated, decades-old rivalry. \u2026 Both are about repairing the world; both invite exuberant commitment; both are moralistic. \u2026 Sustainability set aside the driving idea of the original environmental movement, that we help ourselves when we clean up the environment. Sustainability shifts the focus to both the imagined future and the supposed needs of the earth itself. (more)Green Is Far \u2013 What [do] the various \u201cenvironmental\u201d topics have in common[?] \u2026 They are mostly \u2026 at unusually large distances in space, time, and social relation from ordinary folks and concerns. (more)In my enviro econ class we\u2019ve come to concepts like \u201cdegradable,\u201d \u201crenewable,\u201d and \u201csustainable.\u201d People often get very concerned when they imagine that certain common practices can\u2019t continue forever, and want to regulate them to extend how long they could last.  Interestingly, this logic is only applied to a few areas like oil, metals, and farms, but not to most of our industries and practices.For example, consider the sustainability of music. Each new song sits somewhere in a range of originality, from very original to very derivative. The more new original songs are developed and marketed, the harder it gets to develop and market new songs that will be seen as relatively original. Song writers then become more tempted to develop and market recycled versions of old songs.  As the supply of original songs is slowly exhausted, the music industry slowly changes its focus from original to derivative songs.Since original music cannot last forever, we face a \u201csustainability\u201d question regarding whether we are using up the supply of original music too quickly, too slowly, or just right.  Formally, this question is very similar to questions of whether we are using up copper or farmland too quickly. Such things can also be reused, where all else equal reuse is less attractive than first use. But to most people, questions about the sustainability of music, or of novels or movies, seem silly, relative to the usual \u201cserious\u201d sustainability questions. Why?My suggestion: sustainability is a far concept, about what happens on far timescales, so it makes more sense to people as applied to far things.  Near things are to be considered only on near timescales, people assume.Added 9p: Jeremy points us to a very relevant short story by Spider Robinson.","201":" Break Cryonics Down  The essence of analysis is to \"break it down\", to take apart vague wholes into clearer parts.  For the same reasons we make point lists to help us make tough job decisions, or ask people who sue for damages to name an amount and break it into components, we should try to break down these important social claims via simple calculations.  And the absence of attempts at this is a sad commentary on something. [Me last July]Imagine you disagreed with someone about the fastest way to get from your office to Times Square NYC; you said drive, they said fly.  You broke down your time estimates for the two paths into part estimates: times to drive to the airport, wait at the airport, fly, wait for a taxi, ride the taxi, etc.  They refused to offer any component estimates; they just insisted on confidence in their total difference estimate. Similarly imagine some someone who disagree about which of two restaurants was better for a certain group, but wouldn't break that down into who would like or dislike what aspects of the two places.  Or imagine someone who claimed their business plan would be profitable, but refused to break this down into how many of what types of units would be sold when, or what various inputs would cost.  Or someone who said US military spending was worth the cost, but refused to break this down into which enemies were how discouraged from what sorts of damage by that last spending increment.Such silent disputants reject our most powerful tool for resolving disagreements: analysis \u2013 breaking vaguer wholes into clearer parts.  Either they have not used this tool to test or refine their estimates, or they are not willing to discuss such parts with you.  I felt Tyler made this analysis-blocking move in our diavlog:R: So is your skepticism about cryonics based on physics, or some more metaphysical relation of consciousness to physics, or skepticism about current brain science, or skepticism about the social institutions required to make this work?T: I would say all of it, but just that its really hard \u2026 then I'm supposed to think that my head can be frozen and brought back with even a one in a million chance?  I'm just not there.R: OK, so it's just sort of a pure surface implausibility; its not based on the structure or the pieces of the argument.T: Absolutely, that's exactly right.R: OK, so this does come back more to our initial hypothesis for our disagreement, which is I prefer to have some structure where I rely on the conclusions of the structure even if my intuitions will influence which pieces I choose for the structure, and you will more just have a reaction to the overall conclusion, \u2026 T: You're always wanting to give me a number, what's the chance you'll be frozen, what's the chance you'll be thawed out, convert it to an expected utility equation; again I pretty quickly put it into the class of cases of extremely unlikely; payoff might be high, by Pascal's wager payoff might be murky \u2026 I don't think thinking about cryonics is silly at all. \u2026R: But at the end of the day your judgment is based on just a holistic evaluation that seems to say this has a really low chance, that isn't based on a structured calculation of the chances of each parts, its just overall it looks unlikely and thats it.  T: I don't like that word just; your evaluation is as holistic as mine \u2026Here is my break down of the cryonics question.  (This one is from 20 years ago.)Assume you die soon in a way a cryonics org can freeze you with its usual quality.  (If not, you don't have to pay for freezing.)  Regarding the year 2090, consider the conditional probability of each of the following steps, given the previous steps:Civilization still exists and has kept growing in technical capability.Your cryonics org and it successors have kept you continuously frozen.Someone is willing and allowed to pay modest costs to revive you.Brain science has workable input\/output models of relevant brain cell types.Usual freezing quality preserved relevant model-needed details.Cheap scanning tech slices & 2D scans brains at model-needed spatial, chem resolution.Error correction codes reconstruct most connections across slices, fractures.Cheap computers can real-time sim entire scanned sets of connected cells.Sim life seems worth living enough that they don't prefer suicide.Such sims of you are as worthy as your kid of your identifying with them.I choose the year 2090 because that is about twice as far in the future as cryonics orgs have already survived while preserving almost all patients, and it seems plenty of time for scan and sim techs to achieve required levels. Your chance of being usefully revived in 2090 as an em is roughly the product of these ten conditional probability terms.  Ten 90% terms gives a total chance of ~1\/3.  Ten 80% terms gives a total chance of ~10%, except step 4 might be a 50% chance, for a total chance of ~6%, which seems about right to me. More precisely, if folks are reasonably smart about when to try to revive you, your total revival chance is something like a sum across all future times of such calculations, each one given no destructive failed prior attempt. If you make 50K$\/yr now, and value life-years at twice your income, and discount future years at 2% from the moment you are revived for a long life, but only discount that future life based on the chance it will happen, times a factor of 1\/2 because you only half identify with this future creature, then the present value of a 5% chance of revival is $125,000, which is about the most expensive cryonics price now.","202":" Hard Facts: Teaching  More wisdom from Hard Facts:Merit pay for teachers is an idea that is almost 100 years old ahd has been subject to much research.
